It has become difficult to imagine the world without computer. Everywhere computers are used whether it is office, bank, school, college, business, hospitals etc. You must have seen Computers at your home, school or office. Can you guess what type of a device it is?\\n\\nComputer is an electronic device which accepts input, processes it and produces the desired results. Computer is a machine which performs mathematical operations and logical decisions at an extremely fast speed. Computer not only do calculations but also handles different applications at a time.\\n\\nIn this lesson, you will learn about computers, its parts, and its uses in real life.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nAfter reading this lesson you will be able to:\\n\\ndefine Computer.\\n\\ndescribe generations of Computers.\\n\\nlist types of Computers.\\n\\nexplain the uses of Computers.\\n\\n1.1 WHAT IS A COMPUTER?\\n\\nYou already know computer is an electronic device which accepts input, processes it and produces the desired results. Computer is divided into two main components Hardware and Software. Hardware consists of mechanical and electronic device, which you can see and touch. The four main hardware components of any computer are motherboard, processor, RAM, Hard drive. Software consists of programs, operating system etc., Examples of software: Windows 7, Linux, MS Office, Adobe PageMaker etc. Today\\'s Computers have at least one CPU (Central Processing Unit) that performs most calculations and include main memory, control unit, and an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).\\n\\nIntroduction to Computers\\n\\nComputer is a general purpose device that is programmed for some task. Do you know what are the two major characteristics of a Computer? Major characteristics of a Computer are (i) it responds to a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner; (ii) it can execute a pre-recorded list of instructions (a program).\\n\\nFig. 1.1 Desktop Computer\\n\\nInput → → Output → Processing → →\\n\\nFig. 1.2 Basic operation of a Computer System\\n\\n1.1.1 How does a Computer work?\\n\\nIt accepts input from various input devices like keyboard, mouse, scanner, joystick and light pen.\\n\\nMicroprocessor performs arithmetic and logic operation on it and gives result.\\n\\nIt communicates results through output devices like monitor and printer etc.\\n\\nIt stores information in hard disk. There are other storage devices such as computer disk, pendrive, (USB drive) etc.\\n\\n1.2 WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A COMPUTER?\\n\\nSpeed: Computers work at very high speed and are much faster than humans. Do you know one second is very large time period for a computer? A Computer can perform millions of calculations in a microsecond.\\n\\nStorage: Computer can store large amount of data (text, video, picture etc) permanently. You can use this data at any time.\\n\\nAccuracy: Accuracy means to provide results without any error. Computers can process large amount of data and generate error free results. A modern computer processes large amount of information without any error.\\n\\nCommunication: Today\\'s Computers have capability of communicating with other Computers. You can connect two or more computers.\\n\\nIntroduction to Computers\\n\\nAutomatic: A computer as a machine can not start itself but it can perform some work without human intervention. For example, you have large amount of data and you want to perform some calculation on it. For getting the result, you have to run the appropriate software and all the calculation will be done by Computer.\\n\\nDiligence: Unlike human being, computer is free from dullness and lack of concentration. It can work for hours without any error until job is finished.\\n\\nVersatility: Versatility is a most important characteristic of computer. You may use computer to prepare salary slip and at the same time you can use the same computer for paying electricity bill and etc. It means you can perform completely different type of work on a single computer simultaneously.\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 1.1\\n\\nFill in the blanks:\\n\\nComputer is broadly divided into _ and _ categories.\\n\\nExample of system software is ___.\\n\\nPhysical components of computer is called _______.\\n\\nSoftware consists of __, ____.\\n\\n1.3 COMPUTER GENERATIONS\\n\\nThe history of computer development is often referred in the different generations of computer devices. A generation refers to state of improvement in the production process. Each generation of computer is characterized by major technological development that fundamentally changes the way computer operates.\\n\\nFirst Generation\\n\\nThe period of first generation was 1946-59. The computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry for CPU (Central Processing Unit). In this generation mainly batch processing operating system were used. Punched cards, paper tape, and magnetic tape were used as input and output devices. Example: ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer was the first general purpose electronic digital computer), EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer), UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer - world’s first commercially available computer), IBM-701 and IBM-650.\\n\\nSecond Generation\\n\\nThe period of second generation was 1959-65. In this generation transistors were used. It is cheaper, consumed less power, more compact in size, more reliable and faster than the first generation machines made of vacuum tubes. These were also the first computers that stored instruction in their memory. The computers used batch processing and multiprogramming operating system. Example: IBM 1620, IBM 7094, CDC 1604, CDC 3600, UNIVAC 1108.\\n\\nIntroduction to Computers\\n\\nThird Generation\\n\\nThe period of third generation was 1965-71. The computers of third generation used Integrated Circuits (IC’s) in place of transistors. A single IC has many transistors, resistors and capacitors along with the associated circuitry. High-level languages (FORTRAN-II TO IV, COBOL, PASCAL PL/1, BASIC, ALGOL-68 etc.) were used during this generation. Example: IBM-360 series, Honeywell-6000 series, PDP (Programmed Data Processor), IBM-370/168 and TDC-316.\\n\\nFourth Generation\\n\\nThe period of fourth generation was 1971-80. The computers of fourth generation used Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits. VLSI circuits having about 5000 transistors and other circuit elements and their associated circuits on a single chip made it possible to have microcomputers of fourth generation. All the high-level languages like C, C++, DBASE etc., were used in this generation. Example: DEC 10, STAR 1000, PDP 11, CRAY-1 (Super Computer) and CRAY-X-MP (Super Computer).\\n\\nFifth Generation\\n\\nThe period of fifth generation is 1980 onwards. In the fifth generation, the VLSI technology became ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration) technology, resulting in the production of microprocessor chips having ten million electronic components. This generation is based on parallel processing hardware and AI (Artificial Intelligence) software used for Robots designing.\\n\\n1.4 WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF COMPUTERS?\\n\\nComputers are generally classified by speed, memory size and power consumption, though there is considerable overlap:\\n\\nMicrocomputer\\n\\nIt is based on microprocessor chip as CPU. This is the smallest category of Digital Computer. These computers include Personal computer, Desktop computers, Notebook computers, Laptop computers, Tablet computers.\\n\\nPersonal computer - It is a small, relatively inexpensive computer designed for an individual user.\\n\\nDesktop computers - A computer that is used for home application and small office work, is Desktop computer. In this type of computer, monitor is put on the top of computer and it is broad and low. While in tower computer, CPU cases are tall and narrow. In our general life we interact with Desktop Computer.\\n\\nFig. 1.3 Desktop computer\\n\\nIntroduction to Computers\\n\\nNotebook computers\\n\\nIt is a lightweight computer. A notebook size is also very less in comparison to Desktop Computer and Tower Computer. The display of notebook computer is different from Desktop Computer. Notebook computers price is very high in comparison with Desktop computer. It is easy to move from one place to another place. Notebook computer power is same as Desktop Computer. It is made of same configuration like 1 GB RAM, 1 TB HDD, DVD, etc...\\n\\nLaptop computer\\n\\nThis type computer is little different from Notebook computers. Its configuration is near about same as Notebook Computer and it can be in the range of high configuration (4 GB RAM, 1 TB HDD, etc.) to low configuration (500 MB RAM, 500 GB HDD, etc.). Most of the times Laptop Computers are also called Notebook Computers.\\n\\nTablets\\n\\nare smaller than laptop PCs, very lightweight, and easy to carry. But they lack the processing power of a laptop as well as a keyboard input. They rely instead on a stylus and touch screen.\\n\\nMinicomputer\\n\\nA multi-user computer capable of supporting up to hundreds of users simultaneously. These computers are bigger in size and costlier than Microcomputers. Minicomputers are used in universities and big organisations.\\n\\nMainframe computer\\n\\nA mainframe computer is a very large computer capable of handling and processing very large amounts of data quickly. These are used by large institutions, such as government agencies and large corporations.\\n\\nSupercomputers Or High Performance Computer (HPC)\\n\\nA supercomputer is typically used for scientific and engineering applications that must handle very large databases. It is an extremely fast computer that can perform hundreds of millions of instructions per second. The speed of the supercomputer are measured by FLOPS (Floating point operations per second).\\n\\nAPPLICATIONS OF COMPUTERS\\n\\nYou may aware that computers are very productive, efficient and can do anything imaginable. Some of the principle applications of the computer systems are as follows:\\n\\nBusiness\\n\\nBusinessmen use computer in the presentation, analysis, calculation and making charts for their business. They also provide online service to their customers using e-commerce, m-commerce. You or your family member must have used online shopping website for purchasing any products. Usage of the computer has reduced the cost of man power and its delivery in an efficient way.\\n\\nBuildings\\n\\nIn the construction of building, Architects use computer to virtually visualize the complete building. It is performed through different multimedia software. Computer provides accurate structure of buildings with all measurements. It helps in reducing cost of changes and it provides satisfaction to the customer.\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nNow-a-days, you can see computer has become an inevitable part in spheres of life. Students use computer for preparing or completing assignments and submit it.\\n\\nIntroduction to Computers\\n\\nthrough online. There are so many online contents study materials which can be viewed by using internet.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nRetailing: Most of the retailers product are based on barcode. That’s the reason they need computers to read barcode and calculate amount on it. This system helps retailers to sum up so many items within seconds.\\n\\nEnergy: In the energy sectors, companies use computers to calculate items and figure out the place of natural resources. Computers also help in finding the correct geographical location of company’s delivery places, vehicles information and communicating with customers.\\n\\nTransportation: Companies are using computers in the vehicles to provide more services to the consumers. Consumers can easily determine the fuel level, AC system, temperature with the help of this system. Some vehicles do not require driver to reach at destination on predetermined path in some countries.\\n\\nAgriculture: Farmers can check the requirements of their crops on computers. They use it for billing, checking market value of crop, cost of fields and stock value of agricultural firm. Computers help in prediction of weather conditions and estimation of agricultural production also.\\n\\nWeather: High Performance Computers (HPC) are also used for executing the weather models (Programs), analyzing weather conditions based on the data collected from various sources like satellite/ GTS/ Internet data and forecasting weather conditions in advance (3 days advance, weekly advance and even monthly advance) like (i) Rainfall prediction, (ii) Temperature prediction, (iii) Wind speed prediction, (iv) Snowfall prediction etc.\\n\\nGovernment: Indian government is implementing E-Governance project in each department.

The Computer system consists of both hardware and software which works in coordination to give us the correct data. It works on the principle of GIGO, i.e. Garbage in Garbage out. It means give wrong input to the computer then the output will be not appropriate as it cannot think and act like human beings. Have you ever seen computer components? Computer has lot of components inside and each component does a specified job. In this lesson you will learn about computer components in detail.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nAfter reading this lesson, you will be able to:\\n\\nexplain components of computer.\\n\\nlist input devices of computer.\\n\\nlist output devices of computer.\\n\\nexplain about types of memory used in computer.\\n\\ndescribe software.\\n\\n2.1 COMPUTER COMPONENTS\\n\\nDo you know what is computer hardware and software? Computer hardware is the collection of physical components of a computer system which includes monitor, keyboard, hard disc drive (HDD), RAM, motherboard etc. Software is nothing but a set of instructions (programs) that are stored and run by hardware. Hardware components of a computer system are electronic and mechanical parts. The term computer hardware refers to the physical computer components.\\n\\nComputer Components\\n\\nThe major hardware components of a computer system are:\\n\\nProcessor\\n\\nMain memory\\n\\nSecondary memory\\n\\nInput devices\\n\\nOutput devices\\n\\nFor desktop computers, the processor, main memory, secondary memory, power supply and supporting hardware are housed in a metal case. Many of the components are connected to the main circuit board of the computer, called the motherboard. The power supply supplies power to most of the components. Various input devices and output devices are attached through connectors at the rear of the case. Figure 2.1 depicts some of the hardware components of a computer.\\n\\nFig. 2.1 Hardware Components\\n\\n10 Computer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\nComputer Components\\n\\nMotherboard: A motherboard is a square-shaped board that houses all major components such as the RAM chips, PCI slots, processor, batteries, sound cards, video cards, graphic cards, USB ports and all other internal circuitry. Motherboards are available in different hardware configurations and designs.\\n\\nCards: These mainly include video cards, sound cards, graphics cards etc. all of which are installed on the motherboard in their respective slots. These are mainly required for running multimedia applications involving video, audio and graphical images. LAN (Local Area Network) cards and network cards are necessary for computer networking, i.e. connecting your computer to a local network or to the Internet.\\n\\nFans: Most computer cabinets make use of at least two fans - a processor fan and a cabinet fan. Their main purpose is to lower the internal temperature and keep the processing components as cool as possible.\\n\\nUSB Ports: USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports in simple terms are the ports which you use for connecting your MP3 players, digital cameras, flash drives, etc. to your computer. Today, most computers come with a minimum of 4 USB ports although certain high end machines can have up to 8 or even 10 USB ports.\\n\\nCD/DVD Drives: If you wish to run any type of CD or DVD on your computer, installing a CD drive or a DVD drive is a must. There are different types of CD/DVD drives available, each offering the user a variety of features and options.\\n\\nCables: Internal cables which are used to connect the hard drive, CD/DVD drive, etc. are of two types - a data cable and a power cable. Each one has a different physical structure and a different function.\\n\\n2.2 BLOCK DIAGRAM OF COMPUTER\\n\\nFigure 2.2 depicts block diagram of a computer.\\n\\n1 5 8\\n\\nFig. 2.2 Block Diagram of Computer\\n\\nA computer can process data, pictures, sound and graphics. It can solve highly complicated problems quickly and accurately.\\n\\nComputer Components\\n\\nInput Unit\\n\\nComputers need to receive data and instructions in order to solve any problem. Therefore it needs data and instructions. The input unit consists of one or more input devices. Keyboard is one of the most commonly used input device. Other commonly used input devices are mouse, joystick, light pen etc. You will be learning about input devices in section 2.3\\n\\nStorage Unit\\n\\nThe storage unit of the computer holds data and instructions that are entered through the input unit. It preserves the intermediate and final results before these are sent to the output devices. It also saves the data for later use. The various storage devices of a computer system are divided into two categories. Can you guess those two categories? Primary storage and Secondary storage. Primary storage device stores the data temporarily whereas secondary storage device stores the data permanently.\\n\\nOutput Unit\\n\\nThe output unit of a computer provides the information and results of a computation to outside world. Printers, monitor or Visual Display Unit (VDU) are the commonly used output devices. Other output devices are plotters, speakers etc.\\n\\nCentral Processing Unit (CPU)\\n\\nYou may heard that CPU is the brain of the Computer. Do you know why? Because you cannot work on Computer without CPU. CPU process almost all the instructions (like performs calculation, fetches instruction from memory, process instructions) necessary for your computer to perform. Control unit and ALU of the computer are together known as Central Processing Unit (CPU).\\n\\nCPU performs the following functions:\\n\\nIt does all the calculations.\\n\\nIt takes all the decisions.\\n\\nIt controls all the units of the computer.\\n\\nArithmetic Logical Unit (ALU)\\n\\nAll calculations are performed in the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) of the computer. It also does comparison and takes decision. The ALU can perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc., and does logic operations viz, >, <, =, etc. Whenever calculations are required, the control unit transfers the data from storage unit to ALU. Once the computations are done, the results are transferred to the storage unit by the control unit and then it is sent to the output unit for displaying results (output). An additional type of ALU, called Floating Point Unit (FPU) or math co-processor is frequently used to perform specialized functions such as division and large decimal number operations. Now-a-days generally the FPU is included as a part of CPU.\\n\\nComputer Components\\n\\nControl Unit (CU)\\n\\nIt controls all other units in the computer. The control unit instructs the input unit, where to store the data after receiving it from the user. It controls the flow of data and instructions from the storage unit to ALU. It also controls the flow of results from the ALU to the storage unit. The control unit is generally referred as the central nervous system of the computer that controls and synchronizes its working.\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 2.1\\n\\nRAM stands for ...................\\n\\nALU and CU are part of ...................\\n\\nMajor hardware components of computer system are ..........., .................\\n\\n2.3 INPUT DEVICES\\n\\nComputer will be of no use unless it is able to communicate with outside world. Input/Output devices are required for users to communicate with computer. Input devices bring information into computer. Some common Input devices are:\\n\\nKeyboard\\n\\nYou must have used computer keyboard. It is one of the commonly used input device. It is text based input device that allows the user to input alphabets, numbers and other characters. It consists of a set of keys mounted on board.\\n\\nAlphanumeric Keypad Function Keys Special-function Keys Cursor Movement Keys Numeric Keypad\\n\\nFig. 2.3 Keyboard\\n\\nMouse\\n\\nFig. 2.4. depicts a mouse. Mouse is an electro-mechanical device used to point a particular place on the screen and select in order to perform one or more actions. It can be used to select menu commands, start programs etc. It is also called as pointing device.\\n\\nComputer Components\\n\\nThe most conventional kind of mouse has two buttons on top: the left one being used most frequently.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nMouse Actions:\\n\\nLeft Click: Used to select item\\n\\nDouble Left Click: Used to open a file or start a program\\n\\nRight Click: Usually used to display set of commands.\\n\\nDrag and Drop: It allows you to select and move an item from one location to another.\\n\\nJoystick\\n\\nA joystick is a vertical stick which moves the graphic cursor in the direction the stick is moved. It typically has a button on the top that is used to select the option pointed by the cursor. Joystick is used as an input device primarily used with video games, training simulators, and controlling robots.\\n\\nSome other input devices are:\\n\\nScanner: It is used to scan hard copy and sends this as information to the computer.\\n\\nBar Code Reader: Now-a-days you see a bar code on material at every shop which is read by a bar code reader and appropriate information is sent to the computer.\\n\\nComputer Components\\n\\nTouch Screen:\\n\\nIt allows user to make selection by simply touching the screen.\\n\\nLight Pen:\\n\\nLight pen is an input device that utilizes a light sensitive detector to select objects on a display screen. Light pen is similar to a mouse except that with a light pen you can move the pointer and select objects on the display screen by directly pointing to the objects with pen.\\n\\n2.4 OUTPUT DEVICES\\n\\nMonitor\\n\\nis one of the most popular output device. It is also called as Visual Display Unit. The monitor looks like a television screen, except instead of watching television programs on it, the monitor allows for running of computer programs. It is connected to the main computer box.\\n\\nThere are two kinds of monitors:\\n\\nCRT (Cathode Ray Tube)\\n\\nFlat Panel Display Monitor or LCD\\n\\nNow-a-days CRT monitors are not commonly used. Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors are mostly in use.\\n\\nPrinter\\n\\nPrinters are used to produce paper output (hardcopy). Based on technology used, it can be classified as Impact or Non-impact printers.\\n\\nImpact Printers use the typewriting printing mechanism where hammer strikes the paper through a ribbon in order to produce output. Dot-matrix and Character printers fall under this category.\\n\\nNon-Impact printers do not touch the paper while printing. It uses chemical, heat or electric signals to print the symbols on paper. Inkjet, Deskjet, Laser printers falls under this category.\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\n15\\n\\nComputer Components\\n\\nPlotters: Plotter is a special kind of output device that is like a printer, produce images on paper, but does so in a different way. Plotters are designed to produce large drawings or images, such as construction plans for buildings.\\n\\nAudio Output: Sound Cards and speaker\\n\\nThe Audio output is the ability of the computer to output sound. Two components are needed:\\n\\n(i) Sound Card - plays content of digitized recordings.\\n\\n(ii) Speaker, which is attached to sound card.\\n\\n2.5 WHAT IS COMPUTER MEMORY?\\n\\nComputer memory is the part of computer that serves as a repository of information that must be managed and maintained well. It is also known as computer storage. Computer stores its information in three levels:\\n\\nPhysical register in the CPU, located at the top level. The information in the registers can be accessed in one CPU clock cycle.\\n\\nPrimary Memory (executable memory), located at the middle level. For example RAM.\\n\\nSecondary Memory, located at a lower level. For example disk and tape.\\n\\n2.5.1 Primary Memory\\n\\nIt is temporary memory that is used at the time of execution of program. Random Access Memory (RAM) is most common type of memory in computers.\\n\\nRAM\\n\\nFigure 2.7 depicts Random Access Memory. It is volatile memory. In this memory, information is stored till the power supply is given. Data in a computer\\'s primary storage is stored for very fast retrieval. It is called Random Access Memory because any data in RAM can be accessed just as fast as any other data.\\n\\nFig. 2.7 Random Access Memory\\n\\nComputer Components\\n\\n2.5.2 Secondary Memory\\n\\nUSB Drives\\n\\nA USB flash drive, usually portable and rewritable, is a type of flash memory storage device that plugs into a computer\\'s USB port. Flash drives are more expensive than hard drives with the same storage capacity. Fig. 2.8 depicts a USB drive.\\n\\nInternal Hard Disk Drive\\n\\nThe internal hard disk drive is the main secondary storage device that stores all of your data magnetically, including operating system files and folders, documents, music and video. You can think of the hard disk drive as a stack of disks mounted on top of one another and placed in a sturdy case. These are spinning at high speeds to provide easy and fast access to stored data anywhere on a disk.\\n\\nExternal Hard Disk Drive\\n\\nExternal hard disk drives are used when the internal drive does not have any free space and you need to store more data. In addition, it is recommended that you always back up all of your data. An external hard drive can be very useful, as it can safely store large amounts of information. It can be connected by either USB or Firewire connection to a computer and can also be connected with each other in case you need several additional hard drives at the same time.\\n\\nCD-R\\n\\nA CD-R, a type of recordable CD, is an optical secondary storage device. It is also known as a WORM -- write once read many -- medium.\\n\\nDVD (Digital Versatile Disc)\\n\\n- It is an optical disc technology with a minimum of 4.7GB storage capacity on a single side.\\n\\nComputer Components\\n\\n2.6 WHAT IS COMPUTER SOFTWARE?\\n\\nComputer Software is a set of programs used to do different tasks. It is classified mainly into:\\n\\n(i) System Software\\n\\n(ii) Application Software\\n\\nSystem software is a collection of programs that controls the overall operation of a computer system. It can be further divided into Operating System and Utilities.\\n\\nSystem Software Application Software Operating System General purpose Utilities Specific purpose\\n\\nOperating System:\\n\\nOperating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware as well as software resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is a component of the system software in a computer system. Application programs usually require an operating system to function. Examples - Disk Operating System (DOS), Windows, UNIX, LINUX etc.\\n\\nUtilities:\\n\\nUtilities are small programs designed for the smooth functioning of the computer systems e.g. disk cleanup, disk defragmenter, file searching etc.\\n\\nApplication Software:\\n\\nApplication software is a program or group of programs designed for end users to do a specific task. It can be further divided into:\\n\\nGeneral Purpose Application software - These softwares are used in schools and at home for general uses like typing a letter, making a small project or presentation e.g. - word processor, spreadsheets, databases, desktop publishing packages, graphics packages etc.\\n\\nSpecific Purpose Application software - These softwares are designed to do a specific kind of a task e.g. - Railway Reservation system, Payroll Management, Inventory Control System, Library Management System.\\n\\nComputer Components\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 2.2\\n\\nFill in the blanks:\\n\\nKeyboard and mouse are ...................\\n\\nDrag and drop action can be performed through ...................\\n\\nPrinter is an ................... device and scanner is an ................... device.\\n\\nSofware can be classified as ................., ............\\n\\nMS Word is an example of .......................... purpose application software.\\n\\nDisk cleanup is an example of ................... software.\\n\\n...................... sofware is necessary for the computer.\\n\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\n\\nIn this lesson, you have learnt hardware components of Computer like hard drive, motherboard, RAM, CPU etc. You have also learnt about input devices, output devices, memory, primary memory, secondary memory and its uses in our life.\\n\\nSome of the keypoints to remember\\n\\nComputer software is a set of instructions stored and run by hardware.\\n\\nComputer hardware is a collection of physical components of a Computer system.\\n\\nRandom Access Memory (RAM) is volatile memory.\\n\\nControl unit and ALU of the comptuer are together known as CPU.\\n\\nKeyboard, mouse, joystick, scanner are the examples of input devices.\\n\\nMonitor is also called as VDU (Visual Display Unit).\\n\\nMonitor, printer, plotter, sound card and speaker are examples of output devices.\\n\\nComputer software mainly classified into System Software and Application software.\\n\\nTERMINAL EXERCISE\\n\\nExplain any four input devices.\\n\\nList any two output devices.\\n\\nWhat is the difference between primary and secondary memory?\\n\\nComputer Components\\n\\nDepict the block diagram of a Computer.\\n\\nExplain in short the different types of System software and Application software.\\n\\nExplain in short the different components of CPU.\\n\\nDifferentiation between\\n\\nInternal and External hard drive\\n\\nPrimary memory and Secondary memory.\\n\\nANSWERS TO INTEXT QUESTIONS\\n\\nRandom Access Memory\\n\\nCPU (Central Processing Unit)\\n\\nProcessor, Memory, Input or Output devices\\n\\nInput Devices\\n\\nMouse\\n\\nOutput, Input\\n\\nSystem, Application\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\nUtility\\n\\nOperating system\\n\\nDATA REPRESENTATION IN THE COMPUTER\\n\\nComputer is not a human being. But how does it understand your instructions? Did you think about it any time? Computer understands only 1’s and 0’s. Whatever instruction or input you are giving to computer it converts each instruction/input as 1’s and 0’s. With the help of these two digits computer can represent video, picture and numbers also.\\n\\nIn this lesson, you will learn methods of data representation in a computer. You will also learn different types of number systems in data representation.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nAfter reading this lesson you will be able to:\\n\\nexplain about data representation.\\n\\nlist the types of number system used in computer.\\n\\nconvert from one number system to other.\\n\\n3.1 DATA REPRESENTATION\\n\\nData representation refers to the method used to represent information stored in a computer. Computer stores different types of information like number, text, graphics, video, sound, charts, images etc.\\n\\nAll types of information stored in a computer are stored internally in the form of 0’s and 1’s. It is very interesting that only with 1 and 0 everything is represented. Computers use numeric codes to represent all the information.\\n\\nData Representation in the Computer\\n\\nMemory Structure in Computer:\\n\\nMemory consists of bits (0 or 1). A single bit can represent two pieces of information (either 0 or 1).\\n\\n1 Nibble is equivalent to 4 bits.\\n\\n1 Byte is equivalent to 8 bits, a single byte can represent 256 = 28 different things.\\n\\nEach byte has its own address.\\n\\nBinary Numbers\\n\\nDo you know the origin of the word “Bi”? It is a Latin word. Do you know the meaning of the Latin word “Bi”? Bi means two. Binary numbers are 0’s and 1’s. Any positive integer (whole number) can be easily represented by a sequence of 0\\'s and 1\\'s. Numbers in this form are said to be in base 2 and these are called binary numbers.\\n\\nText\\n\\nText can be represented easily by assigning a unique numeric value for each symbol used in the text. For example, the widely used American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII explained in section 3.3) defines 128 different symbols (all the characters found on a standard keyboard, plus a few extra), and assigns each symbol to a unique numeric code between 0 and 127. In ASCII, “A” is 65, “B” is 66, “a” is 97, “b” is 98, and so forth. When you save a file as “plain text”, it is stored using ASCII. ASCII format uses 1 byte per character. 1 byte gives only 256 (128 standard and 128 non-standard) possible characters. The code value for any character can be converted to base 2. Any written message made up of ASCII characters can be converted to a string of 0’s and 1’s.\\n\\nGraphics\\n\\nGraphics that are displayed on a computer screen consist of pixels: the tiny “dots” of color that collectively “paint” a graphic image on a computer screen. The pixels are organized into many rows on the screen. In one common configuration, each row is 640 pixels long, and there are 480 such rows. Another configuration is 800 pixels per row with 600 rows, which is referred to as a “resolution of 800×600”. Each pixel has two properties: its location on the screen and its colour.\\n\\nA graphic image can be represented by a list of pixels. Imagine all the rows of pixels on the screen laid out end to end in one long row. This gives the pixel list, and a pixel\\'s location in the list corresponds to its position on the screen. A pixel\\'s color is represented by a binary code, and consists of a certain number of bits. In a monochrome (black and white) image, only 1 bit is needed per pixel: 0 for black, 1 for white, for example. A 16 color image requires 4 bits per pixel. Modern display hardware allows for 24 bits per pixel, which provides an array of 16.7 million possible colors for each pixel.\\n\\nData Representation in the Computer\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nTV CRT PC CRT X041 LCD LCD Fig. 3.1: Pixels in Different Display Devices\\n\\n3.2 NUMBER SYSTEM\\n\\nComputer stores and processes two basic types of data viz., character and number. The character type data includes alphabets and some special symbols. For example, student name in class, roll number, etc.\\n\\nDigital computers internally use binary (base 2) number system to represent data and perform arithmetic calculations. The binary number system is very efficient for computers, but not for humans. Representing even relatively small numbers with binary system requires working with long strings of ones and zeroes.\\n\\n3.2.1 Decimal and Binary Numbers\\n\\nHave you heard about decimal numbers? In the decimal number system, there are ten possible values that can appear in each digit position, and so there are ten numerals required to represent the quantity in each digit position.\\n\\nThe decimal numerals are from zero to nine (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\\n\\nWhen you write decimal (base 10) numbers, you use a positional notation system. Each digit is multiplied by an appropriate power of 10 depending on its position in the number:\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n843 = 800 + 40 + 3 = 8 × 100 + 4 × 10 + 3 × 1\\n\\n= 8 × 102 + 4 × 101 + 3 × 100\\n\\nData Representation in the Computer\\n\\nFor whole numbers, the rightmost digit position is the one’s position (100 = 1). The numeral in that position indicates how many ones are present in the number. The next position to the left is ten’s, then hundred\\'s, thousand’s, and so on.\\n\\nTable 3.1: decimal and their 4 bit binary equivalents.\\n\\nDecimal Pattern Binary Pattern (in 4 bit) 0 0000 1 0001 2 0010 3 0011 4 0100 5 0101 6 0110 7 0111 8 1000 9 1001 10 1010\\n\\nIn a positional notation system, the number base is called the radix. Thus, the base ten system that you normally use has a base of 10. When writing numbers in a base other than ten, or where the base is not clear from the context, it is normal to specify the base using a subscript. Thus, in a case where the base is not understood, decimal numbers would be written like this:\\n\\n12710 1110 567310\\n\\nIn binary, counting follows a similar procedure, except that only two symbols 0 and 1 are used. Thus, after a digit reaches 1 in binary, an increment resets it to 0 but also causes an increment of the next digit to the left (i.e., 10).\\n\\nSince binary is a base-2 system, each digit represents an increasing power of 2, with the rightmost digit representing 20, the next representing 21, then 22, and so on. To determine the decimal representation of a binary number simply take the sum of products of binary digits and the powers of 2 which they represent. For example, the binary 100101 is converted to decimal form as follows:\\n\\nData Representation in the Computer\\n\\n1001012 = [ ( 1 ) × 25 ] + [ ( 0 ) × 24 ] + [ ( 0 ) × 23 ] + [ ( 1 ) × 22 ] + [ ( 0 ) × 21 ] + [ ( 1 ) × 20 ]\\n\\n1001012 = [ 1 × 25 ] + [ 0 × 24 ] + [ 0 × 23 ] + [ 1 × 22 ] + [ 0 × 21 ] + [ 1 × 20 ]\\n\\n1001012 = 3710\\n\\n3.2.2 Octal Number System\\n\\nOctal (this word is derived from Latin word Octo meaning 8) or oct is the base 8 number system uses digits (0-7), i.e.: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\\n\\nTo determine the decimal representation of an octal number simply take the sum of products of octal digits and the powers of 8 which they represent.\\n\\nExample: Octal Number - 1257 converted to decimal equivalent as follows;\\n\\n1258 = [(1 × 84) + (2 × 83) + (5 × 82) + (7 × 81) + (0 × 80)10]\\n\\n= 4096 + 1024 + 320 + 56 + 0\\n\\n= 54910\\n\\n3.2.3 HexaDecimal Number System\\n\\nHexadecimal or hex is base 16 number system. It uses 16 distinct symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.\\n\\nThe alphabets (A to F) represent the values ten to fifteen.\\n\\nFor example - Hexadecimal Number 19FDE converted to decimal equivalent as follows;\\n\\n19FDE = (1 × 164) + (9 × 163) + (F × 162) + (D × 161) + (E × 160)\\n\\n= 65536 + 36864 + 3840 + 208 + 14\\n\\n= 10646210\\n\\nAll four number systems are equally capable of representing any number.\\n\\n3.2.4 Conversion from one Number System to Another\\n\\nDecimal to Binary Conversion\\n\\nYou can use the successive division method for decimal to binary conversion.

ASCII was developed long time ago and now the non printing characters are rarely used for their original purpose. Below is the ASCII character table and this includes description of first 32 non printing characters.

EBCDIC uses the full 8 bits available to it. So, parity checking cannot be used on an 8 bit system. Also, EBCDIC has a wider range of control characters than ASCII.\\n\\nThe character encoding is based on Binary Coded Decimal (BCD). The contiguous characters in the alphanumeric range are formed up in blocks of up to 10, from 0000 binary to 1001 binary. Non alphanumeric characters are almost all outside the BCD range. There are four main blocks in the EBCDIC code page: 0000 0000 to 0011 1111 is reserved for control characters; 0100 0000 to 0111 1111 are for punctuation; 1000 0000 to 1011 1111 for lowercase characters and 1100 0000 to 1111 1111 for uppercase characters and numbers.\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 3.2\\n\\nFill in the blanks:\\n\\nNibble = ................. bits.\\n\\nOctal numbers uses digits from ................. to ..................\\n\\nCharacter representation in computer is done by using ................. code.\\n\\nASCII stands for ..................\\n\\nEBCDIC stands for ..........................\\n\\nData Representation in the Computer\\n\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\n\\nIn this lesson, you have learnt that computer understands only binary value, 0 or 1.

As the input, output and storage devices have already been discussed in the previous lessons, the main focus in this lesson will be on the working and functioning of the internal components, modules and sub-assemblies of the system box.\\n\\nThe system box has a number of components inside it like CPU, motherboard, RAM, expansion cards etc. All these components, along with the external devices, perform a task together.\\n\\nHave you ever looked inside a system box before, or seen pictures of the internal components? This lesson will make you aware of some of the basic terminologies and major components and will help you in understanding in brief, about what goes-on inside the computer system box while a task gets performed. If you are familiar with the parts of the computer, you will definitely be comfortable in assembling a system according to the requirement.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nAfter reading this lesson, you will be able to:\\n\\nidentify the components in the system unit, CPU and motherboard.\\n\\ndistinguish among the data bus, address bus and the control bus.\\n\\noperate the commonly used various plug and play devices.\\n\\nlocate the slots for various external cards.\\n\\nidentify various peripheral devices connected internally and externally.\\n\\n32\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\n4.1 COMPONENTS OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM\\n\\nA computer system comprises of a number of components. In this section, you will learn about the components that are responsible for working of the computer system.\\n\\n4.1.1 Central Processing Unit\\n\\nEvery PC has a Central Processing Unit (CPU). You already know that CPU is the brain of the computer system. Every computer will have a specific type of processor, such as a Pentium chip or an AMD chip. Now let us understand how CPU works. It connects to the motherboard and works alongside the other components, processing many instructions at the same time among the different hardware and memory systems. The processor, as shown in Fig. 4.2, is an electronic device, about one inch square, covered with plastic. Inside this square, there are even smaller squares of silicon, containing millions of tiny electronic parts. A processor may contain 100 million transistors. The chip is usually about the size of a thumbnail. The CPU fits into the motherboard\\'s CPU socket, which is covered by the heat sink, an object that absorbs heat generated in the CPU and dissipates it into the atmosphere. The CPU does the fundamental computing within the system, and directly or indirectly controls all the other components. The speed of the processor is given by its clock speed. A processor\\'s speed is measured in megahertz (MHz), or millions of instructions per second, and gigahertz (GHz), or billions of instructions per second. A faster processor can execute instructions more quickly. However, the actual speed of the computer depends on the speed of many different components.\\n\\nThere are many processor manufacturers for personal computers, but the most well-known ones are Intel and AMD. Advancements in CPU technology have led to systems typically with Dual Core, Triple core or Quad Core processors (on one single chip) instead of the traditional one core per chip. Now all the cores can fit into a single socket as before and a single heat sink and fan can keep everything at the right temperature. CPUs come in different types and speeds. The different versions released by Intel are: 4004, which is a 4-bit processor. 8085, which is a 8-bit processor. 286, a 16-bit processor. 386, 486, 586, 686, K5, K6, K6 MMX, Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium MMX, Pentium II, Pentium III and Pentium IV, which are 32-bit processors. Itanium, Pentium D, Celeron, Core Duo, Core 2 Duo, Core 2 Quad, I3, I5 and I7 have 64-bit processor.\\n\\nA 64-bit processor generally has data and addressing registers that are 64 bits wide that allows storing 264 different values. Hence, a processor with 64-bit memory addresses can directly access 264 bytes of byte addressable memory.\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\nExternal data buses or address buses with different sizes from the registers, even larger (the 32-bit Pentium had a 64-bit data bus, for instance). A generalization would be to suggest that 64-bit architecture would double the amount of data a CPU can process per clock cycle, compared to 32 bit. Users would note a performance increase because a 64-bit CPU can handle more memory and larger files. One of the most attractive features of 64-bit processors is that it can address up to 1 Terabyte (1024GB) of memory.\\n\\nThe processor of the computer system is comprised of Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Control Unit (CU). The processor is responsible for synchronization of instructions and logical and arithmetic operations on the data. In a microcomputer, both ALU and CU are integrated on a single microprocessor chip. The system unit also includes circuit boards, memory chips, ports and other components. A microcomputer’s system cabinet may also house disk drives, hard disks, etc., but these are not considered to be part of the CPU.\\n\\nFunctions of Control Unit\\n\\nNow we will execute some instructions and understand the functions of Control Unit. Suppose the program or software needs to execute the following instructions:\\n\\nDeclare X, Y, Z\\n\\nRead X and Y\\n\\nZ = X + Y\\n\\nDisplay Z\\n\\nControl bus is used to carry signals that decide what work has to be done like reading, storing, calculation, comparison etc.\\n\\nData bus is used to carry data.\\n\\nAddress bus is used to carry memory address of the data is carried by the data bus.\\n\\nInterpretation & Execution of a program by the CU using System Bus\\n\\nThe control unit recognizes that the program has been loaded into the primary memory and it begins to execute the first line in the program. This is accomplished with the help of control signals initiated by the control unit via the control bus. The control unit reads line (1) and directs the primary memory using the control bus to assign memory addresses to variables X, Y and Z (which is communicated via address bus). In simple words, X, Y and Z are three memory variables that are created in RAM for storage purpose.\\n\\nThe control unit reads the line (2) and directs the input device, using the control bus, to enter data for X and Y. It also sends the memory addresses of X and Y via the address bus. The values entered travel via the data bus to the control unit. And then again using all the three buses the data gets stored in their respective corresponding addresses in the primary memory.\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\nThe control unit reads the line (3) using Databus, Control bus, and Address bus and retrieves the values of variable X and Y from primary memory and sends to the ALU for the addition of X and Y. The sum is again moved with the help of bus to primary memory and gets stored in Z variable.\\n\\nThe control unit reads the line (4). Data bus Control bus and Address bus retrieves the value of Z variable from primary memory and send it to the output unit to display the sum.\\n\\nFollowing are some of the additional components that support the working of the CPU:\\n\\nBus\\n\\nBus is a transmission path in which signals/data travers within a Computer i.e., address, data, and control bus together constitute the System Bus. In the previous section, you have learnt about the usage of address bus, data bus and control bus. The CPU performs primarily the following four operations:\\n\\nMemory Read: Reads data or instruction(s) from memory.\\n\\nMemory Write: Writes data or instruction(s) into the memory.\\n\\nI/O read: Accepts data from input device.\\n\\nI/O write: Sends data to output device.\\n\\nAll these operations are performed using a communication process that involve 3 steps:\\n\\nIdentify the peripheral or the memory location. It uses the address bus.\\n\\nTransfer data. It uses the data bus.\\n\\nProvide timing or synchronization signal. It uses the control bus.\\n\\nAddress bus\\n\\nThe address bus is a group of wires or lines which is generally identified as A0, A1, A2, and so on. It is unidirectional. Bits flow in only one direction, from the CPU to the peripheral devices. In a computer system, each peripheral or memory location is identified by a binary number, called an address, and the address bus carries an address of a memory location or a peripheral device. The size of the address bus determines the maximum RAM capacity which the processor can address.\\n\\nData bus\\n\\nThe data bus is a group of wires used for data flow. These lines are bidirectional i.e., data flow in both directions between CPU and the peripheral devices. Suppose CPU has 32-bit data bus which implies that it can manipulate 32 bit data. And sometimes we may call it a 32-bit processor. That means 232 different characters can be represented. The data bus influences the microprocessor architecture considerably. It determines the word length and register size of a processor.\\n\\nControl Bus\\n\\nThe control bus is comprised of various signal lines that carry synchronization signals. These are not group of lines like address or a data bus, but individual lines that provide a pulse to indicate an operation in the CPU. The signals are device specific and are used to activate that device for the specific operation.\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\n4.1.2 Registers\\n\\nNotes The ALU and Control Unit (CU) communicate with each other and perform operations in memory locations using a register. Registers are used to quickly accept, store, and transfer data and instructions that are being used immediately by the CPU. Do you know the types of Registers?\\n\\nTypes of Registers\\n\\nMemory Address Register (MAR): This register holds the memory addresses of data and instructions. It is used to access data and instructions from memory during the execution phase of an instruction. Suppose CPU wants to store some data in the memory or to read the data from the memory. It places the address of the required memory location in the MAR.\\n\\nProgram Counter: The program counter (PC) is a processor register. It is a 16 bit special function register in the 8085 microprocessor. It keeps track of the next memory address of the instruction that is to be executed once the execution of the current instruction is completed. In other words, it holds the address of the memory location of the next instruction when the current instruction is executed by the microprocessor.\\n\\nAccumulator Register: This Register is used for storing the results that are produced by ALU.\\n\\nMemory Data Register (MDR): It is the register of a computer\\'s control unit that contains the data to be stored in the RAM. It is the data that gets stored after being fetched from the computer storage. It acts like a buffer and holds anything that is copied from the memory ready for the processor to use it. MDR holds the information before it goes to the decoder.\\n\\nThe MDR is a two-way register. When data is fetched from memory and placed into the MDR, it is written to in one direction. When there is a write instruction, the data to be written is placed into the MDR from another CPU register, which then puts the data into memory. 5. Index Register: A register which holds a number that can be added to (or, in some cases, subtracted from) the address portion of a computer instruction to form an effective address. Also known as a base register used for modifying operand addresses during the run of a program. 6. Memory Buffer Register (MBR): This register holds the contents of data or instruction, read from, or written in memory. It means that this register is used to store data/instruction coming from the memory or going to the memory.\\n\\nCache Memory\\n\\nThe speed of CPU is extremely high compared to the access time of main memory. Therefore, the performance of CPU decreases due to the slow speed of main memory. To minimise the mismatch in operating speed, a small memory chip is attached between CPU.\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\nand main memory whose access time is very close to the processing speed of CPU. It is called Cache memory. Cache memories are accessed much faster than conventional RAM. It is used to store programs or data currently being executed or temporary data frequently used by the CPU. It is also very expensive to have larger size of cache memory. Main memory access by the CPU may take as long as 180 ns. However, it may take 45 ns to access external cache memory or, even less for internal (Level 1) or on-board (Level 2) cache. While the CPU is processing information retrieved from cache, the cache controller is refreshing cache with data and instructions from main memory or a storage device. Fig. 4.3 depicts cache memory chips.\\n\\nThere are two categories of cache memory: Internal and External.\\n\\nIn older CPUs, and even in some current CPUs, internal cache memory is located in the CPU, and external is located on the motherboard between the RAM and the CPU. It is often called \\'cache RAM\\'. Internal Cache memory is often called \"level 1\" or L1 cache. External cache is often called \"level 2\" or L2 cache. L2 Cache may be on-board (in the CPU chip) or in Static RAM (SRAM) chips on the motherboard. External cache acts as a quick access buffer between the RAM and L1 cache in the CPU.\\n\\nL2 Cache RAM is a small block of high-speed memory, usually SRAM (Static RAM), located between the CPU and main memory. It is used to store data or instructions that are used often. There are several types of SRAM having a speed of 4-8 ns.\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 4.1\\n\\nThe task of performing arithmetic and logical operations is performed by ______.\\n\\n(i) ALU\\n\\n(ii) Editor\\n\\n(iii) storage\\n\\n(iv) output device\\n\\nThe ALU and CU are jointly known as ______.\\n\\n(i) RAM\\n\\n(ii) ROM\\n\\n(iii) CPU\\n\\n(iv) None of the above\\n\\nData, control and address bus together constitute ______ bus.\\n\\n(i) System\\n\\n(ii) CPU\\n\\n(iii) memory\\n\\n(iv) speed\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\n4.

The measuring unit of memory is byte where\\n\\n1 Byte = 8 bits 1024 Byte = 1 Kilo Byte (KB) 1024 KB = 1 Mega Byte (MB) 1024 MB = 1 Giga Byte (GB) 1024 GB = 1 Tera Byte (TB)\\n\\nHave you heard the types of memory? There are two types of computer memories: Primary and Secondary. Primary memory is accessible directly by the processor. ROM and RAM are the parts of a primary memory. ROM stores some basic programs, pre-programmed by the manufacturer, while RAM is the area where data gets stored temporarily.\\n\\nThe storage capacity of the main memory is also very limited. Often it is necessary to store hundreds of millions of bytes of data for the CPU to process. Therefore, additional memory is required in all the computer systems. This memory is called auxiliary memory or secondary storage or secondary memory. In this type of memory the cost per bit of storage is low. However, the operating speed is slower than that of the primary memory. Huge volume of data are stored here on permanent basis and transferred to the primary storage as and when required. Most widely used secondary storage devices are magnetic tapes, magnetic disks, flash drives, CD-ROM etc.,\\n\\nROM\\n\\nThe ROM is Read Only Memory that can only be read by the CPU but it cannot be changed or modified as the name suggests. The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is stored in the ROM that checks and initializes various peripherals attached to the PC when the switch is turned ON. \"BIOS\" is a pre-programmed software that controls the computer\\'s start up processes and other basic components such as keyboard, monitor/display, disk drives, etc. The programs that are preloaded in the ROM are also known as firmware. A conventional ROM looks like as shown in Fig. 4.4.\\n\\nThe memories, which do not lose their content on failure of power supply, are known as non-volatile memories. ROM is a non-volatile memory. This area is only readable by the user and cannot be used for storing data.\\n\\nFig. 4.4 ROM\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\nROM can be categorized into two types:\\n\\nThe permanent type - includes Masked ROM and PROM\\n\\nSemi-permanent includes EPROM and EEPROM.\\n\\n1. PERMANENT ROM\\n\\na) Masked ROM:\\n\\nIn this ROM, a bit pattern is permanently recorded by the masking and metallization process. It is an expensive and specialized process.\\n\\nb) PROM:\\n\\nIt is Programmable Read Only Memory. This memory has ni-chrome or polysilicon wires arranged in a matrix. These wires can be functionally viewed as diodes or fuses. This memory can be programmed by the user with special software that selectively burns the fuses according to the bit pattern to be stored. You know that it is not possible to modify or erase programs stored in ROM, but it is possible for you to store your program once in PROM chip. Once the programs are written, these cannot be changed and remain intact even if power is switched off. Therefore, programs or instructions written in PROM cannot be erased or changed.\\n\\n2. SEMI PERMANENT ROM\\n\\na) EPROM:\\n\\nThis stands for Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory, which overcomes the problem of PROM and Masked ROM. EPROM chip can be programmed time and again by erasing the information stored earlier in it. It uses the technology of charging gates, using high voltage. Information stored in EPROM can be erased by exposing it to ultraviolet light.\\n\\nb) EEPROM:\\n\\nThis stands for Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory. This concept is same as that of EPROM. The only difference is that the memory can be altered using electrical signals. The whole of the memory need not be erased.\\n\\nRAM\\n\\nRAM stands for Random Access Memory. It randomly selects and uses any location of the memory directly to store and retrieve data. It takes same time to retrieve any address of the memory as it takes for the first address. It is also called read/write memory. The storage of data and instructions inside the primary storage is temporary, i.e. data or instruction stored in RAM disappears from RAM as soon as the power to the computer is switched off. So now we can say that RAM is a volatile memory. You can store and retrieve data much faster with primary memory compared to secondary memory. Secondary memory such as floppy disk, magnetic disk, etc., are external and located outside the motherboard whereas RAM is located on the motherboard.\\n\\nRAM is also referred to as Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM). It consists of chips of memory, either in short chips (Dual In-line Pin (DIP) chips) or in memory modules. Memory modules are either \"Single Inline Memory Modules\" SIMMs or \"Dual In-Line Memory Modules\" DIMMs. A single 30-pin SIMM can hold up to 4MB and a 72-pin SIMM can hold up to 32 MB of memory. Nowadays, DRAM comes in either DDR, DDR2 or DDR3 form.\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\nThe term \"DDR\" stands for Double Data Rate. DDR SDRAM was capable of two data transfers per clock cycle, giving it twice the theoretical peak bandwidth of previous SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory or Synchronous DRAM is a type of memory that synchronizes itself with the computer’s system clock). DDR2 RAM provides 4 data transfers per cycle, while DDR3 increases the number to 8. Assuming a base clock speed of 100Mhz, DDR RAM will provide 1600 MB/s of Bandwidth, DDR2 provides 3200 MB/s, and DDR3 provides 6400 MB/s. Examples of DDR2 and DDR3 RAM are shown below in the Fig. 4.5.\\n\\nDDR 2 Key notch position for DDR2 RAM DDR 3 Key notch position for DDR3 RAM\\n\\nFig. 4.5 DDR2 RAM and DDR3 RAM\\n\\nThese are also known as Magnetic Disk. It is an external storage unit that is located inside the system box. It looks like as given in Fig. 4.6. You might have seen the gramophone record, which is circular like a disk. Magnetic disks used in computer are made on the same principle. It rotates with very high speed inside the disk drive. Data are stored on both the surface of the disk. Each disk consists of a number of invisible concentric circles called tracks. Information is recorded on tracks of a disk surface in the form of tiny magnetic spots. The presence of a magnetic spot represents one bit (1) and its absence represents zero bit (0). The information stored in a disk can be read many times without affecting the stored data.\\n\\n4.1.4 Motherboard\\n\\nMotherboard also known as main board, it provides the connectivity and holds the various internal components in the system box. Computer major components that work to process data, are located on the motherboard as shown in fig. 4.7. It is made up of fibreglass, typically brown or green in colour, with a meshwork of copper lines. Power, data, and control signals, also called traces, travel to all components through these electronic circuits. A group of these wires assigned to a set of functions is called a bus. The components of a motherboard are: Chipset, Microprocessor or CPU, Clock chip, Memory, Bus, ports etc.\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nForm Factors\\n\\nIn order to bring about uniformity in the design of motherboard so that further designing and assembly of a computer system may be eased, designs of motherboards of computer systems have been standardized. These standardizations are called Form Factor. A motherboard form factor defines the type and location of components, the power supply capacity and the processor type, that will fit onto the motherboard. There are several motherboard form factors, each with different layouts, components, and specifications. Any specific motherboard will be suitable only for certain processors and types of memories, based on type of processor and memory sockets installed on the motherboard. The form factor is also a deciding factor for the use of video, sound cards, hard drive controllers (PATA and SATA) and support for various port types (parallel, serial, USB, etc). Therefore, if you want to assemble a computer, it must be ensured that the motherboard, the power supply, processor, memory and the box are compatible with each other. Form factors like ATX and BTX are commonly used in the motherboard industries.\\n\\nATX\\n\\nIt is a short form of Advanced Technologies Extended form factor. With the need for a more integrated form factor which defined standard locations for the keyboard, mouse, I/O, and video connectors, in the mid 1990\\'s, the ATX form factor was introduced. The ATX form factor brought about specific changes to the motherboard, along with the case and power supply. Some of the design specification improvements of the ATX form factor included a single 20-pin connector for the power supply, a power supply to blow air into the case instead of out for better air flow, less overlap between the motherboard and drive bays, and integrated I/O Port connectors soldered directly onto the motherboard. The ATX form factor was overall a better design for upgrading a system.\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\nBTX: Balanced Technology Extended form factor, unlike its predecessors is not an evolution of a previous form factor but a total break away from the popular and dominating ATX form factor. BTX was developed to take advantage of technologies such as Serial ATA, USB 2.0, and PCI Express. Changes to the layout with the BTX form factor include better component placement for back panel I/O controllers and it is smaller than micro ATX systems. The BTX form factor enables the industry to develop smaller size systems with an increased number of system slots. Today the industry accepts the ATX form factor as the standard.\\n\\nMemory Slots\\n\\nThe motherboard has slots or sockets for system memory as shown in fig 4.8. Depending on the motherboard form factor, special sockets accept the memory card. These memory cards come in various types of DRAM or SDRAM memory sticks, also called modules. These sticks are Single Inline Memory Module (SIMM), Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM), and RAMBUS Inline Memory Module (RIMM). SIMM is the oldest technology, while DIMM and RIMM are the current standards. Both of these physical memory slot types move data 64 bits or 128 bits at a time. For example, a motherboard having 6 memory slots, 4 DIMM slots for DDR2 and 2 DIMM slots for DDR3. The slots look similar, but DIMM for DDR2 have 184 pins while DIMM for DDR3 have 240 pins.\\n\\nProcessor Slots\\n\\nEvery motherboard contains at least one CPU socket, and its location depends on the form factor. A common CPU socket type is a zero insertion force (ZIF) socket, which is square in shape, has a placement lever that holds the CPU securely when closed, and makes it easy to put CPU in the socket when open. Various types of CPU sockets like PGA (Pin Grid Array), SPGA (Staggered Pin Grid Array) and LGA (Land Grid Array) are used on the motherboard for the CPU placement. These socket types use different technologies for connection between the processor and the motherboard. Fig. 4.9 shows a typical slot for a processor.\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 4.2\\n\\n1024 KB = 1 _______.\\n\\n(i) MB\\n\\n(ii) GB\\n\\n(iii) TB\\n\\n(iv) ZB\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\nROM is ____ .\\n\\n(i) Volatile memory\\n\\n(ii) Non-volatile memory\\n\\n(iii) Secondary memory\\n\\n(iv) Temporary memory\\n\\nThe hard disk is a part of motherboard.\\n\\n(i) True\\n\\n(ii) False\\n\\n(iii) cannot say\\n\\nZIF is ____ .\\n\\n(i) Zero Insertion Point\\n\\n(ii) Zero Insertion Force\\n\\n(iii) Zero Insertion Fact\\n\\n(iv) None of these\\n\\n4.1.5 Clock Chip and CMOS battery\\n\\nThe components in a computer are designed to operate in perfect synchronization with one another. This requires a time keeper. The clock chip provides the timing signals in the form of electronic pulses that are used by the internal components to set up a working pace. The chip generates a regular beat like the ticking of a clock and the operations are timed to this beat. The faster the beats, higher is the speed of the processor. The speed of a clock is measured in terms of frequency of pulses generated. Its unit is MHz (Mega Hertz). For example, a PC of third generation has a clock speed of 2.4 GHz. It is one way of measuring speed of a computer.\\n\\nCMOS is an acronym for Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor and is shown in fig. 4.10. It is the term usually used to describe the small amount of memory on a computer motherboard that stores the BIOS settings. The CMOS is usually powered by a CR2032 cell battery. Most CMOS batteries will last the lifetime of a motherboard (up to 10 years in most cases) but will sometimes need to be replaced. Incorrect or slow system date and time and loss of BIOS settings are major signs of a dead or dying CMOS battery.\\n\\nThe function of the CMOS battery is to maintain important information for the BIOS to begin the start-up sequence in computers. Remember, BIOS is pre-programmed software loaded in ROM. It stores the date and time and the system configuration details.\\n\\n4.1.6 Drives\\n\\nThere are different types of drives:-\\n\\nHard Disk Drive (HDD):\\n\\nHave you seen Hard Disk Drive? A hard disk drive usually looks like a small size book but actually is a much heavier device as shown in Fig. 4.11.\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\nThe hard disk drive is the main, and usually largest, data storage device in a computer. Can you guess what are the files stored in HDD? The operating system, software files and most other files are stored in the hard disk drive. The hard drive is sometimes referred to as the \"C drive\" due to the fact that Microsoft Windows designates the \"C\" drive letter to the primary partition on the primary hard drive in a computer by default. The sides of the hard drive have pre drilled, threaded holes for easy mounting in the system box. The hard drive is mounted so that the end with the connections faces inwards of the computer. The rear end of the hard drive contains a port for a cable that connects it to the motherboard. It also has a connection for power supply.\\n\\nCD/DVD Drive\\n\\nThis is also known as optical drive. Optical drives retrieve and/or store data on optical discs like CDs, DVDs, and BDs (Blu-ray discs) which hold much more information than any portable media like a floppy disk. Most optical drives can play and/or record onto a large number of different disc formats. An example of this drive is given in Fig 4.12.\\n\\nPopular optical drive formats include CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-RAM, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-R DL, DVD+R DL, BD-R, and BD-RE. The front of the optical drive has a small open/close button that ejects and retracts the drive bay door.\\n\\nThe sides of the optical drive have pre-drilled, threaded holes for easy mounting in the 5.25 inch drive bay in the system box. The optical drive is mounted so that the end with the connections faces inwards of the computer and the end with the drive bay faces outwards. The rear end of the optical drive contains a port for a cable that connects it to the motherboard. It also has a connection for power supply.\\n\\nTape Drive\\n\\nA tape drive is a data storage device that reads and writes data onto a magnetic tape. Magnetic tape data storage is typically used for offline, archival data storage. It looks like fig. 4.13. Tape media generally is much cheaper and is of long archival stability.\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\nA tape drive provides sequential access storage, unlike a disk drive, which provides random access storage. A disk drive can move to any position on the disk in a few milliseconds, but a tape drive must physically wind tape between reels to read any one particular piece of data. As a result, tape drives have very slow average seek times.\\n\\n4.1.7 Chipset\\n\\nThe chipset is made up of one or more electronic components that connect(s) and control(s) the motherboard components, such as processor, expansion bus, and internal memory. All components communicate with the processor through the chipset, which is also called the hub of data transfer. Chipsets are a series of chips soldered onto the motherboard and are not upgradable without a replacement. Every processor has a different chipset. The speed of the motherboard is determined by the speed of the chipset.\\n\\n4.1.8 Ports\\n\\nAll the input and output devices like keyboard, printer and the mouse are connected to the system through ports. These ports are the interfaces for external devices on the motherboard. The CPU communicates with the outside devices, using these ports. Different ports of a computer are shown in fig. 4.14. Modern computers don\\'t require many of these ports these days as most external connections go through the generic USB ports. However, some of these ports may be found to be existing on the motherboard. Usage and functioning of each of these ports are explained below:\\n\\nPS/2 Keyboard Connector PS/2 Mouse Connector Serial Port Communicator Parallel Port VGA Port USB Ports Gigabit RJ-45 Ethernet LAN Port Audio Jack Microphone Jack Line in Jack\\n\\nFig. 4.14 Different Ports of a Computer\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\n(a) USB port\\n\\nUniversal Serial Bus (USB) is a popular port for high speed wired communication between electronic systems peripherals and devices with or without a computer. It eliminates the mix of different ports for different devices like printers, keyboards, mouse, and other peripherals. That means USB-bus allows many peripherals to be connected using a single standardized interface socket. USB also allows hot swapping means that the devices can be plugged and unplugged without rebooting the computer or turning off the device. That means, when plugged in, everything configures automatically.\\n\\n(b) PS/2 Port\\n\\nATX boards have 2 PS/2 ports, one for the mouse and the other for the keyboard. These are of same size and shape but with a different colour. This is because the mouse and keyboard connectors are not interchangeable. Plugging the keyboard in to the mouse connector and vice versa will make both of them useless. The usual way for these to be plugged in is to plug the mouse into the green port and the keyboard into the purple port.\\n\\n(c) Serial Port\\n\\nThe serial port is a type of connection that is used for peripherals such as mouse, gaming controllers, modems, and older printers. It is sometimes called a COM port or an RS-232 port which is its technical name. There are two types of serial ports -- DB9 and DB25. DB9 is a 9-pin connection, and DB25 is a 25-pin connection. A serial port can only transmit one bit of data at a time, whereas a parallel port can transmit many bits at once. The serial port is typically the slowest port you will find on a PC. Today\\'s computers have replaced serial ports with much faster and more compatible USB ports.\\n\\n(d) Parallel Port\\n\\nThe parallel port is mainly used for scanners and printers, and is associated with LPT1. It uses a 25-pin connector (DB-25) and is rather large compared to most new interfaces. Parallel ports send data in parallel i.e. more than one bit at a time. If the channel is 8 bits wide then a parallel port would send 8 bits at a time. These ports are much faster than serial ports. Parallel ports also are fast becoming extinct as the USB ports are taking over their place.\\n\\n(e) Audio Port\\n\\nThe Sound card that is built into the expansion board has three connectors. These are Speaker out, Line in and Mic in.\\n\\n(i) Speaker out is used for the connection of external speakers.\\n\\n(ii) Line in is for external sources of audio that you want to hear through your computer.\\n\\n(iii) Mic in port which is used for the Microphone.\\n\\n(f) VGA Port\\n\\nIt has the accommodation for the pins that are available with the monitor cable. If you have a VGA graphics card then this port will be on the back of your graphics card.\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 4.3\\n\\nCMOS is a type of small _____.\\n\\n(i) clock\\n\\n(ii) memory\\n\\n(iii) processor\\n\\n(iv) socket\\n\\nHDD stands for ____.\\n\\n(i) Hard disk data\\n\\n(ii) Hard disk doctor\\n\\n(iii) Hard disk drive\\n\\n(iv) None of these\\n\\n4.1.9 Cables\\n\\nYou must have seen various cables are used for connecting components in the system box. Each cable has specific configuration and interfaces. Major cables used in the system box, are as follows:\\n\\nParallel Advanced Technology Attachment (PATA) cables: Termed as PATA is an interface for connecting storage devices like hard drives and optical drives to the motherboard. Fig. 4.15 & 4.16 will help you to understand the PATA cables connectivity in the system box. These are long and flat cables with 40-pin connectors or 80-pin connectors on either side. One end plugs into a port on the motherboard, usually labelled IDE, and the other into the back of a storage device like a hard drive.\\n\\nFig. 4.15 PATA Cables\\n\\nFig. 4.16 PATA Cables\\n\\nSerial Advanced Technology Attachment cables: Termed as SATA is an interface used to connect hard drives and optical drives to a computer\\'s motherboard. Fig. 4.17 and 4.18 shows the appearance and use of SATA cable. SATA transfer rates start at 150Mbps, which is significantly faster than even the fastest PATA drives. Do you know besides faster transfer rates, the SATA interfaces have several other advantages over the PATA.\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\ninterface? For instance, SATA drives have their own independent bus, so there is no competition for bandwidth as there is with PATA drives. It also uses smaller, thinner cables, which allows for better airflow inside the computer. SATA cables can be as long as one meter, while PATA cables have a maximum length of 40cm. This gives manufacturers more liberty when designing the internal layout of their computers. Serial ATA uses only 7 conductors, while Parallel ATA uses 40. This means there is less likelihood of electromagnetic interference with SATA devices.\\n\\nHard Disk\\n\\nSata Cable\\n\\nMotherboard\\n\\nFig. 4.17 SATA Cables\\n\\nFig. 4.18 SATA Cables\\n\\n4.1.10 SMPS\\n\\nSMPS stands for Switch Mode Power Supply. SMPS is one of the most important components in the system box. As every electronic component is driven by power, SMPS device receives the main power supply and then converts it into the required voltages that the system requires. Successful operation of such device depends on the functioning of the power supply.\\n\\nIt is a device that takes input from the normal power supply of 240V AC current and converts into 5 V DC and 12 V DC current or as required by the computer. In simple words it steps down the voltage as a computer requires a lesser voltage power. It is also known as a power supply unit (PSU) located inside the system box. It supplies power to the motherboard and also to the other installed devices.\\n\\n4.1.11 CPU Fan\\n\\nFig. 4.19 shows the connector and the motherboard header for the fan assembly. A computer fan is any fan inside, or attached to, a system box used for active cooling of the internal components by drawing cool air into the case from the outside. It expels warm air from inside, or moves air across a heat sink to cool a particular component. The fan moves the heat away from the heat sink.\\n\\nThe heat sink/fan assembly usually has a 3-pin power connector.\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\n4.1.12 Heat Sink\\n\\nFig. 4.20 shows the heat sink. It is a two-part cooling device.\\n\\nThe heat sink draws heat away from the CPU. It is designed in a special way to lower the temperature of an electronic device by dissipating heat into the surrounding air. All modern CPUs require a heat sink. Some also require a fan. A heat sink without a fan is called a passive heat sink; a heat sink with a fan is called an active heat sink. Heat sinks are generally made of aluminium alloy and often have fins to enhance their surface area.\\n\\nFig. 4.20 Heat Sink\\n\\n4.1.13 Connectors\\n\\nMotherboard Power Connectors: Just like other components, motherboard requires power to operate. The ATX main power connector will have 20 or 24 pins. The power supply may also have a 4-pin or 6-pin ATX power connector that connects to the motherboard. A 20-pin connector will work in a motherboard with a 24-pin socket.\\n\\nSATA Power Connectors: SATA power connectors use a 15-pin connector. Serial advanced technology attachment (SATA) power connectors are used to connect to hard disk drives, optical drives, or any devices that have a SATA power socket.\\n\\nMolex Power Connectors: Hard disk drives and optical drives that do not have SATA power sockets use a Molex power connector.\\n\\nBerg Power Connectors: The 4-pin Berg power connector supplies power to a floppy drive Cards.\\n\\n4.1.14 Cards\\n\\nDisplay Adaptor Card: Images that are formed on the monitor use a technology that is provided by a display adaptor card. The key elements of a display adaptor card are the video controller and the memory. The memory is used to store the information of the image before it gets displayed on the screen. The controller does the change that takes place on the image before it gets displayed on the screen.\\n\\nTwo types of display adaptors are available in the market. One type is for display in text mode and the other is for graphics mode. In text mode, individual characters get printed on the screen while in graphics mode the images get formed using dots called pixels. Resolution indicates the number of pixels on the screen. It is an important element that differentiates among various display adaptor cards. Higher the resolution (more the number of pixels), better the quality of pictures displayed on the screen. The different types of display adaptor cards are:\\n\\nEGA: Enhanced Graphics Adapter, is a card that supports 16 colours at a time. It provides a resolution of either 640 x 200 pixels or 640 x 350 pixels.\\n\\nVGA: Video Graphics Array system provides resolution of 720 x 400 pixels. In text mode and graphics mode, the resolution is either 640 x 480 with 16 colours or 320 x 200 with 256 colours.\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\nSVGA\\n\\nSVGA: Super Video Graphics Array, is a higher version of VGA. It provides resolution of:\\n\\n(a) 640 x 480 pixels with 256 to 65536 colours (b) 1024 x 768 pixels with 256 colours (c) 800 x 600 pixels with 256 to 65536 colours (d) 1280 x 1024 pixels with 16 colours\\n\\nVideo Card/Graphics Card\\n\\nThe video card handles video and graphics that are displayed on the monitor. Users who plan to watch DVD\\'s, or edit home videos or play games need a graphics card. Sometimes the graphic processors are built into the motherboard.\\n\\nA video adapter card, is the interface between a computer and a display monitor. Video adapter cards use Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), Advance Graphics Port (AGP), and Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) expansion slots on the motherboard for connectivity.\\n\\nNetwork Interface Card (NIC)\\n\\nA Network Interface Card (NIC) enables a computer to connect to a network. As shown in fig. 4.21, it uses Peripheral Component Interface (PCI) and PCIe expansion slots on the motherboard for connection. NIC allows computers to communicate over a computer network by using cables or wirelessly.\\n\\nFig. 4.21 NIC\\n\\n4.2 MORE ON FLASH MEMORIES\\n\\nFlash memory is an electronic storage medium that can be erased and reprogrammed electrically. Flash memory is a non-volatile storage medium. You may have learnt about non-volatile memory which retains data even after its power supply being switched off. For example, when a Flash storage device is removed from a digital camera, all data (and pictures) which was stored or saved will remain on the Flash storage device.\\n\\nThe ability to retain data is key to flash memory applications such as digital films for digital cameras, mobile phones, tablets and other transportable devices. Flash memory technology is a mix of EPROM and EEPROM technologies. The term \"FLASH\" was chosen because a large chunk of memory could be erased at one time. The name, therefore, distinguishes flash devices from EEPROMs, where each byte is erased individually.\\n\\nNOR and NAND are the two forms of flash memory.\\n\\nNOR Flash memory\\n\\nThe world\\'s leading manufacturers of flash devices (Intel, AMD) use NOR cell configurations. NOR is mostly found in cellular phones (to store the phone\\'s...\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\noperating system) and Personal Digital Assistant (PDAs). It is also used in computers to store the BIOS program.\\n\\nNAND Flash memory: To reduce cell area, the NAND configuration was developed. NAND Flash memory reads and writes in high-speed, sequential mode, handling data in small, block sizes (\"pages\"). NAND Flash can retrieve or write data as single pages, but cannot retrieve individual bytes like NOR Flash. NAND Flash memory is commonly found in solid-state hard drives, audio and video Flash media devices, television set-top boxes, digital cameras, cell phones (for data storage) and other devices where data is generally written or read sequentially. For example, most digital cameras use NAND-Flash based digital film, as pictures are usually taken and stored sequentially. NAND Flash memory is less expensive than NOR Flash memory.\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 4.4\\n\\nChoose the correct answer:\\n\\nSATA is a type of ______ .\\n\\n(i) memory (ii) cable (iii) form factor (iv) processor 2.

Some key points to remember are summarized below:\\n\\nThe CPU is the processor that includes ALU and CU.\\n\\nThe system bus includes data, address and the control bus.\\n\\nAddress bus is unidirectional while data and control bus are bidirectional.\\n\\nData bus carries data and instructions, address bus carries memory addresses while control bus carries the control signals.\\n\\nRegister is a small unit of temporary memory located inside the CPU.\\n\\nCache memory is a small memory chip that lies between the RAM and the CPU. It is used to accelerate data transfer between them.\\n\\nAnatomy of a Computer System\\n\\nROM is a non volatile memory where the BIOS programs are pre loaded by the manufacturer and are used in booting of the system.\\n\\nMotherboard is a printed circuit board that provides connectivity and slots for various internal and external components directly or indirectly.\\n\\nUSB ports are interfaces of connection for external devices.

When you assemble a computer, you have to fit / connect these components with each other. For this job, you need to use a number of tools. Therefore it is necessary for you to be familiar with these tools to use them appropriately.\\n\\nIn the previous lesson, you have learnt about anatomy of a Computer System and various components of a Computer System. You also learnt about their function in a Computer System. In this lesson, you will learn about the tools needed to assemble a computer using these components.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nAfter reading this lesson you will be able to:\\n\\nidentify various tools used in assembling a computer.\\n\\nenlist the uses of each tool.\\n\\n5.1 TOOLS\\n\\nFrom practical point of view, you will not need many tools to assemble a computer. In fact, these days a PC can be assembled using only one screwdriver. But the things are easier if you have some additional tools also. Having these tools will make the job fun and will save you a lot of time. Fig. 5.1 shows some of the tools.\\n\\nScrewdriver set Needle-nose pliers\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\nTools for Assembling Computer\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nWire Cutter\\n\\nAnti-static Wrist Strap\\n\\nCleaning brush\\n\\nTorch (preferably LED and Handsfree)\\n\\nCouplers\\n\\n5.1.1 Screwdriver Set\\n\\nFor small tasks related to computer system hardware, only one screwdriver is sufficient. But if you are serious about hardware assembly, you should have a set of screwdrivers. Screwdriver sets are easily available in the market. Most of the screws used in computers are number two, a few are little bit smaller. Also some screws are hard to reach. Therefore you need screwdrivers with long shafts. Usually screwdriver sets provide you one shaft and multiple changeable bits of different sizes. You must procure such a screwdriver set. The bits are usually magnetic. Magnetic bits help you to pick screws from the locations of hard reach. These also help you to fix the screws with ease.\\n\\n5.1.2 Needle-nose Pliers\\n\\nNose pliers are useful when you have to pick and hold some cables. Sometimes screws reach such locations from where it is difficult to pick them by hand. In such situations nose pliers are helpful.\\n\\nTools for Assembling Computer\\n\\n5.1.3 Wire Cutter\\n\\nNow-a-days, all the components and cables are available in such a form that there is no need to cut any cables. However, there may be some situations where you will have to cut some cables, there you will require a wire cutter.\\n\\n5.1.4 Couplers\\n\\nIf you need to make a cable joint inside a Computer in some situation, do it using couplers. This ensures safety from short circuits.\\n\\n5.1.5 Anti-static Wrist Strap\\n\\nStatic electricity is the biggest danger to the expensive parts you are about to assemble. Even a tiny shock, very small for you to feel, can be harmful to some computer parts. To save the components from static electricity, it is important to use your anti-static wrist strap. After you have the power supply installed (NOT switched on) in the case, clip the end of the wrist strap to the outside of the power supply. This will ensure that there is no inequality of charge that will allow a spark to jump from you to the case.\\n\\n5.1.6 Cleaning Brush\\n\\nSometimes you may need to remove dust from the computer parts. A small painting brush can be used to do that job. You can keep a convenient painting brush with you and use it when required.\\n\\n5.1.7 Torch (Preferably LED and Handsfree)\\n\\nIt is always preferred to work at a place where there is sufficient light. But in real life situations, you may sometimes have to work at dimly lit areas. In such cases a torch will prove to be very helpful. The torch should be hands free with some hook or stand so that you can easily place it at any convenient location. You cannot work properly if you have to hold the torch with your hands or chin or neck. It is preferred to use an LED torch as it has much longer life than the conventional torch and consumes far less energy.\\n\\n5.2 PRECAUTIONS\\n\\nA computer runs on electricity and expensive electronic components are used in it. Therefore, it is very important to be careful and take precautions while assembling (or disassembling) a computer. Here, we enlist a few such precautions:\\n\\nSwitch off and unplug the computer before starting any work on it.\\n\\nKeep the screwdriver handle clean. A greasy handle could cause an injury or damage from unexpected slippage.\\n\\nAlways use screwdrivers that have insulated handles designed for electrical work.\\n\\nTools for Assembling Computer\\n\\nPrepare a place to keep any screws that you may remove. A container or piece of paper with labels for each part (casing, motherboard, CD drive, etc) is ideal to avoid confusion between the similar-looking screws.\\n\\nIf a component does not come out easily, do not forcefully remove it. Instead, check that you are removing it correctly and that no wires or other parts are in the way.\\n\\nAlways use suitable screwdriver to suit the screw.\\n\\nDo not apply any extra force to fit any screw. If a screw is not fitting with normal turn of the screwdriver, it means the screw is either misfit for that place or it has not been properly positioned.\\n\\nDo not use pliers on the handle of a screwdriver for extra turning power.\\n\\nDo not use defective screwdrivers (i.e., ones with rounded or damaged edges or tips; split or broken handle; or bent shaft).\\n\\nDo not hold the screws or any such item in one hand while using the screwdriver with the other. If the screwdriver slips out of the slot, it may injure your hand.\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 5.1\\n\\nCleaning Brush is required to:\\n\\n(A) Paint the outer box\\n\\n(B) Spread lubricant\\n\\n(C) Not required at all\\n\\n(D) Clean the dust\\n\\nCouplers are used for:\\n\\n(A) Joining cables\\n\\n(B) Cutting wires\\n\\n(C) Picking screws\\n\\n(D) Removing Dust\\n\\nPrecautions that need to be taken while assembling a computer include:\\n\\n(A) Not to apply an extra force\\n\\n(B) Clean handling\\n\\n(C) Insulated screwdrivers\\n\\n(D) All of the above.\\n\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\n\\nIn this lesson, you have learnt about:\\n\\nDifferent tools are used for assembling a computer.\\n\\nScrewdriver set which is the most important tool in the toolkit used for computer assembly.\\n\\nPrecautions that must be taken while assembling or disassembling a computer.\\n\\nTools for Assembling Computer\\n\\nTERMINAL EXERCISE\\n\\nWhy should you have screwdriver set and not just a single screwdriver for assembling a computer?\\n\\nWhat is the importance of anti-static wrist strap?\\n\\nMohit is learning computer system assembly. He does not have any pliers in his toolkit. What kind of difficulties may he have to face during practicals?\\n\\nList any four precautionary measures to be taken while working with screwdrivers.\\n\\nWhy should you not apply extra force to fit the screws?\\n\\nANSWERS TO INTEXT QUESTIONS\\n\\nD\\n\\nA\\n\\nD\\n\\nASSEMBLING A PERSONAL COMPUTER\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nIn the previous lesson, you have learnt various tools used in computer assembly and precautions to be taken while assembling and dis-assembling a computer. Now you are ready for assembling a computer. Assembling and dis-assembling a computer are not very difficult jobs. With some practice and careful handling of devices and knowledge in computer hardware components one can easily do this.\\n\\nIn this lesson you will learn step-by-step procedure for assembling a personal computer and dis-assembling a personal computer.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nAfter reading this lesson you will be able to:\\n\\nopen the case.\\n\\ninstall and uninstall power supply.\\n\\nattach the required components to the motherboard.\\n\\ninstall and uninstall internal drives.\\n\\nattach internal cables.\\n\\n6.1 ASSEMBLING PROCEDURE\\n\\nStep 1: Procure the Parts\\n\\nFor assembling, personal computer following parts are required:\\n\\nMotherboard\\n\\nComputer Case (body) and Power Supply (Switched Mode Power Supply)\\n\\nAssembling a Personal Computer\\n\\n3.

It is a rectangular box which contains most of the components of a computer system. Now-a-days cabinet has built-in SMPS (Switch Mode Power Supply). SMPS takes the 240V AC (Alternating Current) input and supplies the required voltages to the components of computer system.\\n\\n2. Processor\\n\\nA processor is the brain of a computer. The speed of a computer depends mainly on the processor speed. The processor speed is measured in megahertz (mHz) or gigahertz (gHz).\\n\\nAssembling a Personal Computer\\n\\n3. Heat sinks and Cooling fans:\\n\\nWhen a computer starts, lot of heat is generated. To reduce the heat inside the computer, heat sinks are mounted on the processors.\\n\\n4. Motherboard:\\n\\nAs you know already that motherboard is the main circuit board in which all the components (like CPU, memory, mass storage interfaces, connectors for input and output devices etc.,) of a computer system are attached. The specifications of a motherboard depends on many factors like the chipset it has, maximum RAM it can support, bus speed, processor to be used etc.\\n\\n5. RAM:\\n\\nRandom Access Memory (RAM) is also referred as main memory or primary memory. RAM is used to store the data temporarily when the computer is on.\\n\\n6. Hard Disk Drive (HDD):\\n\\nHDD is a data storage device. HDD stores all the software and data which we want to use in the computer. Hard disks capacities varying from a few GB to a few TB. This is also called secondary memory.\\n\\n7. SATA Cables:\\n\\nSerial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) or Serial ATA cables that connects HDD and optical drive to the motherboard.\\n\\nThese are the components to be fixed inside the system box.

Serial ATA or Serial Advanced Technology Attachment cable.\\n\\nPreparing System for Installation\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nPREPARING SYSTEM FOR INSTALLATION\\n\\nIn the previous lesson, you have learnt about how to assemble a Computer System. Once we have assembled, the computer has to be made ready for use by installing various softwares. But one must be aware of the hardware and software requirements before preparing for installation. When you first startup your computer, setup the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS). Whenever you build the system or make any changes in its components, you need to run the BIOS setup. It additionally manages flow of information between the computer’s software package and its connected peripheral devices.\\n\\nOnce the system is switched on, a set of operations is performed, which is known as booting. After booting you will proceed in the identification of Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and the device driver. In this lesson you will learn in detail about various aspects of installation in a computer system.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nAfter reading this lesson you will be able to:\\n\\nlist the functions of BIOS.\\n\\nexplain the types of booting.\\n\\ndifferentiate different types of Hard Disk Drives (HDD).\\n\\nlist out the purposes of device drivers.\\n\\n7.1 BIOS (BASIC INPUT/OUTPUT SYSTEM)\\n\\nBIOS is a type of firmware. When BIOS boots up (starts up) it loads the operating system from hard disk or diskette drive into computer system’s Random Access Memory. With BIOS, your computer system understands exact details about the attached input and output devices. Any modification in a computer requires changes in BIOS program.\\n\\nPreparing System for Installation\\n\\n7.1.1 The BIOS Program\\n\\nManufactures of processors and BIOS programs always follow a defined regulation. BIOS program will be allocated a fixed place in memory where the processor can look for. This place contains the initial code of BIOS program which starts executing and then begin. The boot sequence that will call different programs and load operating system in memory. The BIOS instructions are usually placed in a special pre allocated memory space.\\n\\n7.1.2 Flash BIOS\\n\\nThe BIOS program in your system is programmed into a Read Only Memory (ROM). ROM which unlike RAM is not re-writeable, that is why they are referred to as \"read-only\". This creates an issue if you want to go for any changes in the BIOS. In the earlier days any changes required in the BIOS lead to a brand new BIOS chip which could only be provided by the manufacturers. With advancements in technology BIOS has started coming as a flash drive, which is easy to upgrade.\\n\\nSystems having flash BIOS facility use a special variety of BIOS memory referred to as associate EEPROM, which means \"Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory”. It can be easily deleted and changed employing a special program. This method is named as flashing the BIOS, which provides easy access at reduced cost.\\n\\nMotherboards are now-a-days available to provide some “safety feature” to stop accidental (or malicious) changes (refer BIOS attack) to the flash BIOS. It is a jumper that has to be modified before acting as a flash BIOS upgrade. This additional security feature provides the facility feature of not to open the case, (which may be described in the manual provided along with motherboard).\\n\\nThe biggest disadvantage of upgrading BIOS with flash process is that BIOS is more exposed and sometimes if power supply interrupts then it may lead to corrupted BIOS chip. System can be corrupted if you boot with the incorrect flash BIOS chip consisting of wrong data/instructions.\\n\\n7.1.3 BIOS Attack\\n\\nAn unauthorised alteration of the BIOS in a PC, is called as BIOS attack i.e. BIOS attack infects the BIOS with malicious code. BIOS routines are run when the computer is booted. BIOS with malicious code, while booting takes complete control of the computer.\\n\\n7.1.4 Boot Block\\n\\nThe system can go to unbootable state if the flash process is not finished properly. This is because it may corrupt the BIOS code. Boot block helps to overcome from a state where the BIOS code is wrong or corrupted. Hence when next time the boot block loads up, it runs the correct code.\\n\\nPreparing System for Installation\\n\\n7.2 BIOS CMOS MEMORY\\n\\nNotes The BIOS settings must be saved in non-volatile memory so that it is accessible later when the system is reopened. A special variety of memory is employed to store this data, referred to as CMOS memory. It has small battery which is used to trickle a little charge to ensure that there is no loss of information.\\n\\nCMOS is expanded as \"Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor\", a technology that helps to create semiconductors like processors, chipset chips, DRAM, etc. CMOS has the benefit of requiring less power as compared to any another technology. This is the reason why it is selected, so that the quantity of power needed from the battery would be negligible.\\n\\nCMOS checksum is used as an error-detecting code. CMOS checksum error shows that boot up settings which were set earlier have been changed. On every occasion the system is booted, the system recalculates and compares it to the stored result. If they are totally different, then the system is aware that the CMOS has been corrupted warns you with a some message, like “CMOS confirmation Error”.\\n\\nAs technology has evolved, various alternative kinds of batteries are used to supply power to the CMOS. BIOS setup is stored in CMOS in-built memory. Plug and Play BIOS carry a non-volatile memory to carry extended system configuration information which holds the resource configurations of system devices once Plug and Play is employed. CR2032 lithium coin cells are used to supply power to memory and real-time clock.\\n\\nThe durability of these cells varies from 2 to 10 years, determined by the motherboard type, time during which machine is switched off and the surrounding temperature. BIOS settings will be reset as default, if the cell is replaced, but if cell is replaced when power supply is on, changes in settings will not happen.\\n\\n7.2.1 CMOS Memory Block\\n\\nA battery provides backup so that the settings do not seem to be lost once the machine is switched off or unplugged. But sometimes certain things cause the CMOS memory to be erased or loose its settings. This might happen if the battery fails owing to some type of malfunction, or simply as a result of some motherboard error.\\n\\nIt is therefore advisable to keep a copy of the CMOS memory data. In normal conditions the battery can last for a long period of time keeping their BIOS setting intact. Backup is required only if there is any modification.\\n\\nCMOS backup is not same as the regular backup. Alternative ways that are used for CMOS backup are:\\n\\nPreparing System for Installation\\n\\nManual Backup: It is done manually, by recording all current settings of the BIOS. Though it is a lengthy process but it is reliable.\\n\\nCMOS Backup Utilities: In this the various utilities automatically take the backup of the data at regular interval of time, which can be further stored to a storage device. If something happens accidentally, some of these utilities restore the complete CMOS settings.\\n\\n7.3 BOOTING\\n\\nWhen a computer is switched on, a set of instructions (operations) are performed by a computer. This complete process is known as booting. This process is repeated every time a machine is switched on after being turned off. This power-on self testing takes few seconds to complete. This process involves initializing peripheral devices and loading the operating system.\\n\\nSystem starts with a little set of instructions in ROM and then subsequently the operating system is loaded on to the RAM. As the system is switched off, software as well as data are stored on nonvolatile storage devices.\\n\\nMany systems use computer networks for booting. In this case, operating system is kept on the server, and a portion of it is shifted to the user’s system with the help of Trivial File Transfer Protocol. After the transfer, the operating system takes over the control of the booting process of the user’s machine.\\n\\nTypes of Booting\\n\\nWarm Booting: A warm booting is started from the operating system. To perform warm boot in Windows operating system, you have to select, restart from the Start menu. In warm booting, there is no need of pressing a button on the computer itself.\\n\\nCold Booting: To perform a cold booting or hard booting you have to start up the computer which is turned off. A cold booting is done by pressing the power button to switch on the system. In both types of booting the system clears the RAM and starts the boot sequence from scratch. Warm booting might not clear all caches, which stores temporary informations. If you are troubleshooting your computer, you have to perform cold booting.\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 7.1\\n\\nBIOS is:\\n\\nA. Application Software\\n\\nB. Hardware\\n\\nC.

A warm booting is done by pressing the power button of your computer. 3. The boot operation starts by running an initial set of instructions. 4. Operating system is in the Random Access Memory when system is turned on.\\n\\n7.4 HARD DISK DRIVE (HDD)\\n\\n7.4.1 Determining the Speed or RPM of a Hard Drive\\n\\nTo confirm the speed or Revolutions Per Minute (RPM) of a Hard drive you need to first determine the manufacturer and model of the drive. Once you have confirmed this, you will search for the drive on the manufacturer’s web content to see the revolutions per minute of the drive. You may also look the sticker on the HDD to examine its revolutions per minute.\\n\\nDisk Utilities\\n\\nMany disk utilities that are designed to setup the hard drive can find and setup a hard drive; For instance, the fdisk utility will show extra data regarding the scale of the disk drive and also partition of data. You can have the list of all precise data concerning your Hard Disk, like specifying the manufacturer, model, type, and size of the drive.\\n\\n7.4.2 Jumpers\\n\\nJumpers allow the system to close or open an electrical circuit. It is made of small pins set that can be covered by jumper block. A Jumper is also known as appropriately sized conductive sleeve. A jumper is called closed jumper when it is covering at least two pins and an open jumper when it is covering only one pin or no pin.\\n\\n7.4.3 Cable Select\\n\\nAnother method of setting up the hard disk is Cable Select system. As obvious, which connector on the cable is connected to a device; decides whether it is designated as master or slave. Master/slave is a model of communication where one device has one-way control.\\n\\nFig. 7.2: Jumper\\n\\nPreparing System for Installation\\n\\nover one or more devices. The advantage of this system is that when hard disk is changed from slave to master or vice versa, settings need not to be changed. With the design of this new system, connecting hard drives becomes easier as master/slave jumper settings are not required to be configured again and again. Cable Select also known as CS, is completely different from traditional IDE cables.\\n\\nWith the advancement in the technology, enhancement in the concept of CS has also happened. You are able to set each drive to CS connect. To deploy cable select, each of the hard disks must be set to the \"cable select\" (CS) setting, typically employing a jumper, with the usage of a special cable which typically has three connectors, with the center one supposed for the motherboard. The remaining two connectors are used alternatively to connect to the drives which can act as master or slave. The drives can be inter-changed by altering the connector on the cable they use.\\n\\n7.5 DEVICE DRIVERS\\n\\nDevice driver is a set of instructions that determines and helps in using a peripheral device which is connected with the system. Once a program calls a particular procedure within the driver, it sends instructions to the device. Drivers are specific to hardware and dependent on operating system.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nModern hardware and operating system drivers work in numerous environments. Drivers may interface with many devices such as: printers, video adapters, Network and sound cards, image scanners or digital cameras etc.\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 7.2\\n\\nState True or False\\n\\nA jumper is closed when it is covering only one pin or no pin.\\n\\nWe use small tools like tweezers or very small plier to change the settings of jumper.\\n\\nDevice driver is a set of instructions, that helps in using peripheral devices which is connected with the system.\\n\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\n\\nIn this lesson you have learnt about BIOS, flash BIOS, functioning of BIOS, attacks on BIOS, CMOS and its backup, bootstrap loading and its types, HDD, jumpers, Master/Slave HDD, device drivers and their purpose and applications of device drivers.\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\nPreparing System for Installation\\n\\nSome of the Keypoints to remember\\n\\nBasic Input Output System (BIOS) is a type of firmware.\\n\\nAn unauthorised alteration of the BIOS in a PC is called as BIOS attack.\\n\\nCMOS Checksum is used as an error-detecting code.\\n\\nWhen a computer is switched on, a set of instructions performed by a computer is known as booting.\\n\\nTERMINAL EXERCISE\\n\\nWhat is a BIOS Attack?\\n\\nDescribe Flash BIOS?

It is the platform on which all other applications are installed. Hence Operating System installation ensures that the hardware meet the least requirements for running the system efficiently.\\n\\nYou are also aware that data in Computers is stored in the form of files. To manage, organize these files on various storage media, we have file systems. File system is a method of managing various files in the computer. This lesson will make you understand the system requirements, file system and installation steps for Windows and Linux (Ubuntu) Operating Systems.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nAfter reading this lesson you will able to:\\n\\nlist file system used in Windows operating system.\\n\\ninstall Windows 7 operating system.\\n\\nlist the types of file system used in Linux.\\n\\ninstall Linux (Ubuntu) Operating System.\\n\\n8.1 WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM\\n\\n8.1.1 File System\\n\\nAs mentioned before, a file system is a technique for managing files on various storage media, such as hard disks, CDs etc. In the Microsoft Windows operating system, users are provided with the various options of file systems while formatting such media. In Windows the following two most common file systems are used:\\n\\nFAT\\n\\nNTFS\\n\\nOperating System Installation\\n\\nFile Allocation Table\\n\\nThe File Allocation Table (FAT) 32 and FAT were used in earlier versions of Windows operating systems. It was developed by Microsoft to manage data on storage media. FAT contains names of files, date and time stamps, names of directories and attributes of files. The FAT system is compatible with all major operating systems. It was the default file system for all Windows operating systems prior to Windows 2000. But FAT suffers from few problems such as over-fragmentation, file corruption and limits to file names and size.\\n\\nNew Technology File System\\n\\nMicrosoft required an operating system which gives additional steadiness and wellbeing measures. The Windows objective was to design an operating system that ought to be as secure as Unix, supported expanded filenames, had network capability and did not waste storage space. In 1993, Microsoft released Windows nongovernmental association 3.1 with NTFS (New Technology File System) version 1.0. NTFS provides a well-formed file system that is largely used by Windows 2000 and XP and was developed by MS Corporation for its Windows NT line of operating systems, beginning with Windows NT 3.1 and Windows 2000, including Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and all their successors to date.\\n\\nNTFS is refined as compared to FAT file system in a number of respects:\\n\\nFile compression - NTFS can compress files.\\n\\nEncryption - provides strong and secure files or folders.\\n\\nJournaling - NTFS is a journaling file system (uses NTFS log to record changes).\\n\\nHard links - allows different file names to directly refer to the same file contents.\\n\\n8.1.2 WINDOWS 7\\n\\nWindows 7 uses the NTFS (New Technology File System) which is the most regularly utilized system these days. This is a file of an extraordinary configuration that is found on the MFT (Master File Table) zone of an allotment. The master file table (MFT) is a database in which information about every file and directory on an NT File System (NTFS) volume is stored. There is at least one record for every file and directory on the NTFS logical volume. Each record contains attributes that tell the operating system (OS) how to deal with the file or directory associated with the record. This zone is just accessible to OS administration applications and concentrated devices that can address the hard drive straightforwardly. For e.g., windows kernel, device drivers etc. The MFT is a table that runds all files with their traits and security parameters. The MFT likewise stores locations of divisions (hard drive clusters) where file substances (fragments) are physically present.\\n\\nOperating System Installation\\n\\nWindows\\n\\nThis is the imperative folder that is placed on the computer’s hard disk partition. It keeps all executables, drivers and libraries of the system. That is the reason it is emphatically prescribed not to erase files from folder. This folder may have an alternate name.\\n\\nUsers\\n\\nThis folder contains client (users) profiles. Naturally it is found in the root folder of the system partition. It contains various standard folders. These folders contain different client subfolders including desktop, documents, pictures, favorites. Other subfolder is utilized to store data of different applications, programs, appdata, application data, cookies, local settings and others. You should not change their substance unless you are truly certain what you are doing.\\n\\nBoot\\n\\nThis folder contains working system boot files. It is covered up, and it is not prescribed to change its content.\\n\\nProgram data\\n\\nApplications store their information, setup files and other data in this folder. One should not erase anything from this folder.\\n\\nRecuperation\\n\\nThis folder contains data needed to log into the System Recovery Console. It is concealed and you can not change its content.\\n\\nRecycle.bin\\n\\nThis folder is Windows Recycle Bin which contains the erased files. The folder is covered up, however you can securely erase its content and in addition the folder itself. The files in this folder can be restored.\\n\\nWindows 7 Installation\\n\\nTo start the installation of WINDOWS 7 on any supported PC, you must start with the modifying your BIOS settings to make your PC boot from a CD/DVD or USB drive before it boots from the primary hard disk.\\n\\nInsert a genuine Windows 7 CD in your DVD-ROM drive.

It is a secured operating system.\\n\\n8.2.1 LINUX File System\\n\\nFile system types used in Linux are Ext3 (Extended File System), Ext4, VFAT (Virtual File Allocation Table) and Swap.\\n\\n8.2.2 Partitioning of Disk\\n\\nYou prefer to have partitions in your disk. If your hard disk failed / crashed only that particular partition will be affected, whereas other partitions will have your files. Objectives of having diverse partitions is to accomplish higher information security if some crash or hard disk failure occurs. When a mishap happens, only the concerned partition information will be affected, whereas other partitions are likely to survive.\\n\\nLinux has two segments in it:\\n\\nData segment: It is a typical Linux framework information, including the root part containing all the information to run the framework; and\\n\\nSwap segment: It is an extension of the machine’s physical memory, additional memory on hard drive.\\n\\nMount Points\\n\\nWindows operating system uses drives (C, D, E etc.,) to access disk space. Linux uses mount points. In Linux mounted disk space, all folders will be under the root of the file system. i.e., ‘/’ forms the root of the file system. Examples of mount points: /bin, /root, /home.\\n\\nInode entry\\n\\nFor most clients and for most typical framework association errands, it can be recognized that records and lists are in a tree structure, whereas machine does not understand tree-structures.\\n\\nIn a record framework, which is simply the collection of records (inode numbers and hard links pointing to the actual data) a report is identified with an inode number, a kind of.\\n\\nOperating System Installation\\n\\nSerial number containing information about the genuine data that makes up the record: to which this archive has a spot, and it is set on the hard disk tracks. A special type of link called hard link is used to point to the actual contents of the file stored on disk tracks. Hard links are stored beside the inode number for a particular file in the inode entry.\\n\\nEach part has its own specific set of inodes; all through a framework with different segments, records with the same inode number can exist. Each inode depicts a data structure on the hard drive, securing the properties of a record, including the physical zone of the report data. Exactly when a hard drive is instated to recognize data stockpiling, generally in the midst of the starting framework foundation methodology or when adding extra plates to a current framework, a settled number of inodes is made. This number will be the best measure of records, of diverse sorts (tallying registries, one of a kind records, joins etc.) that can exist. We ordinarily have 1 inode, each 2 to 8 kilobytes of limit.\\n\\nAt the time another record is made, it gets a free inode. In inode, the accompanying data is:\\n\\nHolder and gathering manager of the file.\\n\\nFile sort type (normal, catalog, ...)\\n\\nContents of the file.\\n\\nDate and time of data created and changed in the inode.\\n\\nNumber of connections to this file (see later in this section).\\n\\nFile size.\\n\\n8.2.3 Ubuntu Installation (Step-wise procedure)\\n\\nTo start the installation of Ubuntu on any supported PC, you must start with the following steps:\\n\\nModify your BIOS settings to make your PC boot from a CD/DVD or USB drive before it boots from the primary hard disk.\\n\\nCreate a bootable copy of the Ubuntu disk image on a CD, USB flash drive and then insert it into the CD/DVD drive or USB port if using a USB drive.\\n\\nFinally, installation begins.\\n\\n1.

The merging of the computer technology with the communication system has given birth to a whole array of networking technologies. The use of a computer to serve a business need is rapidly being replaced by a network of computers, catering to various needs of a business organisation.\\n\\nGerier Yonkstation Wonkstalion Sen\\'e HUB orktstabon workstabon Worssratiot Printer HUB Workstabion Printe Workstaton Wonsstation Worketabo School B Workstation Workstation Aworkslaton School sener Workstation Wcrksiation HUB norkctation Printer WVor staton Wotksraticn Workstation School C\\n\\nFig. 9.1 Network of Computers\\n\\nIn this lesson you will learn about various types of networks, their topologies, communication media, addressing concepts, and network protocols.\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nAfter reading this lesson, you will be able to:\\n\\nidentify various benefits and types of networks.\\n\\ntypes of transmission media.\\n\\nuses of switching techniques.\\n\\nunderstand various types of topologies.\\n\\ndifferentiate between OSI and TCP/IP model.\\n\\n9.1 WHAT IS A NETWORK?\\n\\nIndependent computers, referred to as personal computers (PCs), gave users the ability to create and save documents with the help of different software. However, this was not adequate for large organisations where the volume of work and amount of documents created was high. These computers that are operated independently have a number of limitations, some of which are as follows:\\n\\nSmall hard drive capabilities.\\n\\nResources like data, printers, CD drive cannot be shared.\\n\\nCommunication from one system to another can be done only by using portable storage devices.\\n\\nTo address these above mentioned problems, networks came into existence. It is a group of computers connected to each other physically or logically for data communication.\\n\\n9.2 BENEFITS OF A NETWORK\\n\\nThe evolution of network was a boon to mankind. The amount of time, money and energy saved was very high with the use of network. Benefits of a network are:\\n\\nResource sharing: The main benefit of networking is \"Resource sharing\", and it is to make all programs, data and equipment available to anyone on the network without being influenced by the physical location of the resource and the user.\\n\\nReliability: A second benefit is to provide high reliability by having alternative sources of the same information. For example, all files could be replicated on two or three machines, so if one of them is unavailable, the copies on the other machines could be accessed/used.\\n\\nLower cost: Another benefit is saving money. Small computers have a much better price/performance ratio than larger ones. Mainframes are roughly ten times faster than the fastest single chip microprocessors, but mainframes cost thousand times more.\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\nmore. This imbalance has caused many system designers to build systems consisting of powerful personal computers, one per user, with data kept on one or more shared file server machines. This benefit leads to networks with many computers located in the same building. Such a network is called a LAN (local area network).\\n\\nSystem performance: Another closely related benefit is to increase the system’s performance as the work load increases by just adding more processors. With central mainframes, when the system memory is full, it must be replaced by a larger one. Computer networks provide a powerful communication medium. A file that was updated/modified on a network can be seen by the other users on the network immediately.\\n\\n9.3 ORIGIN OF INTERNET: THE BIGGEST PUBLIC NETWORK\\n\\nDo you know the origin of internet? Evolution of a computer network started way back in 1969 with the development of first network called ARPANET. It was created by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defence. ARPANET was one of the first general-purpose computer networks. It connected time-sharing computers at government-supported research sites, principally universities in the United States, and it soon became a critical piece of infrastructure for the computer science research community in the United States. In the 80\\'s, another organisation called National Science Foundation (NSF) created an independent network called NSFnet, which was more advanced than ARPANET. It allowed only the students and educators of various universities to do their research related work. It did not allow any kind of private business related activities. Later US separated their defence related work in to a separate network called DARPANET. In the 90\\'s ARPANET, NSFnet, and many more private networks across the world shook hands with each other and the combination of them gave birth to today\\'s internet. So internet can be called as super network. Internet can be defined as the worldwide network of computer networks.\\n\\nThese networks have to follow certain rules and regulations to communicate among themselves. The set of rules that governs the communication between the computers in a network is called protocol. The ruling protocol standard followed by internet is TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).\\n\\nOther than the public networks, one can build up a private network which can be accessed if the user has access rights to it. There are business organisations which have their own networks where the users are authenticated using valid User Ids and passwords. Therefore, the benefits and applications of these networks can be enjoyed by only their employees who have access to these privileges.\\n\\n9.4 NETWORK TERMINOLOGIES\\n\\nTo know more on computer networks, you need to learn few important terms of networks.\\n\\nWorkstation: The term workstation or a node refers to the computers that are attached to a network and share the resources in the network. On a network, there can be computers that do not have either a Hard disk (or Floppy disk drives) can not store any data or\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\nSoftware. Such computers are called dumb terminals. They get operated directly with the help of server. On the other hand the computers that can work independently on the network are called intelligent terminals.\\n\\nServer\\n\\nA server is a computer that provides data, software and hardware resources that are to be shared on the network. A network can have more than one server. Each server has a unique name in the network. All network users identify the server by its name. It is of two types:\\n\\n(1) Non dedicated server - It acts as a server and workstation\\n\\n(2) Dedicated server - It can be used as a server only.\\n\\nIntranet\\n\\nIntranet is a private network.\\n\\nInter space\\n\\nIt is client-server software that allows computers in a network to share online audio, video and text through dynamic 3D environment. It provides a real time communication platform on the Internet today.\\n\\n9.5 CLASSIFICATION OF NETWORKS\\n\\nBased on the area covered by the computer network, it is classified as:\\n\\nLAN (Local Area Network)\\n\\nMAN (Metropolitan Area Network)\\n\\nWAN (Wide Area Network)\\n\\nLAN\\n\\nWhen a group of computers get connected in a local area like a building or a school campus for data sharing, then it is termed as a LAN. It usually uses unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables for connectivity. A client server LAN is shown in Fig. 9.2\\n\\nMetropolitan Area Network (MAN)\\n\\nIt covers an area larger than a LAN. Generally, when the network is spread across a city, then it is called a MAN. For example, a school having branches in different parts of the city are connected to form a network. The computers in each of these branches get connected to form separate LANs. These LANs get connected to each other to form a MAN as shown in Fig. 9.3. It usually uses microwave link for communication. It covers an area larger than LAN but smaller than WAN. e.g. cable television network available in many cities.\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\nWorkstation Workstation Workstation Printer HUB Workstation Printer Workstation HUB Workstation Workstation Workstation School B Workstation Workstation Server School A Workstation Workstation HUB School C Workstation Printer Workstation\\n\\nFig. 9.3 MAN\\n\\nWide Area Network (WAN)\\n\\nIt covers an area larger than a MAN. Various computer networks located in different countries can be connected with each other to share information through WAN.\\n\\nIt usually uses satellite for communication. For example, the computer network of a multinational organisation with the head office at California connects to a network of its branches in London. This forms a WAN as shown in fig 9.4.\\n\\nFig. 9.4 Wide Area Network\\n\\nDepending on processing capability and use of the connected computers, a network can be classified into two types: peer-peer network and a client server network.\\n\\nPeer to Peer\\n\\nEvery computer on the network acts as a workstation as well as a server. Any computer on the network can access the shared resources. These networks provide low level security. Fig 9.5 shows an example of a peer to peer network.\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance 103\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nPeer Peer 2 Hub Peer 3 Peer\\n\\nFig. 9.5 Peer to Peer Network\\n\\nClient Server: It consists of client computers and server computers as shown in fig 9.6. A workstation is generally known as a client. A server computer provides services for the client requests. It also handles the security and administrative responds to the tasks of the network. These networks provide high level security. The client computers are dependent on the server computer.\\n\\nServer Client Client Client Fig. 9.6 Client Server\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 9.1\\n\\nInterspace provides _______.\\n\\n(i) storage area\\n\\n(ii) real time communication platform\\n\\n(iii) WAN\\n\\n(iv) None of these\\n\\nWorkstation is a _______.\\n\\n(i) dedicated server\\n\\n(ii) node\\n\\n(iii) port\\n\\n(iv) none of these\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\n9.6 TRANSMISSION MEDIA\\n\\nTransmission media is also known as communication channel. It describes the technologies connecting the computers in a network. It is of two types:\\n\\nWired media\\n\\nWireless media\\n\\nWired media talks of the physical connectivity that takes place using cables while wireless media uses waves through air, water or vacuum. Now let us know about wired media.\\n\\n9.6.1 Wired Media\\n\\nTwisted pair cable: Twisted pair cabling comes in two varieties: shielded and unshielded. Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is the most popular and is generally the best option for small networks. The cable has four pairs of wires inside the jacket (Fig. 9.7). Each pair is twisted with a different number of twists per inch to help eliminate interference from adjacent pairs and from other electrical devices. The standard connector for unshielded twisted pair cabling is an RJ-45 connector.\\n\\nCategories of Unshielded Twisted Pair\\n\\nCategory Speed Use 1 1 Mbps Voice Only (Telephone Wire) 2 4 Mbps Local Talk & Telephone (Rarely used) 3 16 Mbps 10BaseT Ethernet 4 20 Mbps Token Ring (Rarely used) 5 100 Mbps (2 pair) 100 BaseT Ethernet 6 1000 Mbps (4 pair) Gigabit Ethernet\\n\\nAlthough UTP cable is the least expensive cable, it may be susceptible to radio and electrical frequency interference (it should not be used too close to electric motors, fluorescent lights, etc.).\\n\\nShielded Twisted Cables (STP) is a better option than UTP. Each pair of wires in STP is individually shielded with foil. There is a shield around each individual pair, as well as around the entire group of wires. They have 16-155 Mbps of speed.\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\ncan be extended up to maximum 100 meters. Cables require special connectors for grounding but this cabling method resists electrical interference and is less susceptible to overhear.\\n\\n1. Coaxial cable\\n\\nIt has a single copper conductor at its centre. A plastic layer provides insulation between the centre conductor and a braided metal shield. The metal shield helps to block any outside interference from fluorescent lights, motors, and other computers. An image of coaxial cable is shown in fig. 9.8. Although coaxial cabling is difficult to install, it is highly resistant to signal interference.\\n\\nIn addition, it can support greater cable lengths between network devices than twisted pair cable. The two types of coaxial cabling are thick coaxial and thin coaxial. Thin coaxial cable is also referred to as thinnet. 10Base2 refers to the specifications for thin coaxial cable carrying ethernet signals. 2 refers to the approximate maximum segment length being 200 meters. Thin coaxial cable has been popular in school networks, especially linear bus networks.\\n\\nThick coaxial cable is also referred to as thicknet. 10Base5 refers to the specifications for thick coaxial cable carrying ethernet signals. The 5 refers to the maximum segment length being 500 meters. Thick coaxial cable has an extra protective plastic cover that helps to keep moisture away from the centre conductor. This makes thick coaxial a great choice when running longer lengths in a linear bus network. One disadvantage of thick coaxial is that it is difficult to install.\\n\\n2. Fiber optic cable\\n\\nFiber optic cabling consists of a central glass core surrounded by several layers of protective materials as shown in Fig. 9.9. It transmits light rather than electronic signals eliminating the problem of electrical interference. This makes it ideal for certain environments that contain a large amount of electrical interference. It has also been made the standard for connecting networks between buildings, due to its immunity to the effects of moisture and lighting. It has the ability to transmit signals over much longer distances than coaxial and twisted pair cables. It also has the capability to carry information at vastly greater speeds. This capacity broadens communication possibilities to include services such as video conferencing and interactive services.\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\n9.7 NETWORKING HARDWARE\\n\\nModem: A modem is a device that enables a computer to transmit data over telephone or cable lines. Computer information is stored digitally, whereas information transmitted over telephone lines is transmitted in the form of analog waves. A modem converts an analog signal to digital and vice versa. The conversion of data into analog data vice versa, allows two computers to communicate with one another. This is called Modulation/Demodulation (MODEM).\\n\\nDo you know the types of modem? Modems are of two types: internal modem and external modem. Internal modems are fixed inside the system box while the external modem connects CPU externally.\\n\\nRJ-45 connector: It is the short form of Registered Jack - 45 and is an eight-wire connector. It is used to connect computers on a Local Area Network, especially Ethernet LANs. It looks similar to a RJ-11 connector which is used to connect telephone cables. A RJ-45 houses 8 wires while a RJ-11 houses 4 wires. This is a plastic connector that looks like a large telephone-style connector. A slot allows the RJ-45 to be inserted only one way. RJ stands for Registered Jack, implying that the connector follows a standard borrowed from the telephone industry. This standard designates which wire goes with each pin inside the connector.\\n\\nNetwork Interface Controller: In computer networking, a network interface controller (NIC) (also known as a network interface card, network adapter, LAN adapter) is a computer hardware component that connects a computer to a network. It provides the hardware interface between a computer and a network. Some NIC cards work with wired connections while others are wireless. Most NICs support either wired Ethernet or Wifi standard. In new computers, many NICs are now pre-installed by the manufacturer. NIC contains connections for either twisted pair cable or coaxial cable or both.\\n\\nHub: It is a device for connecting multiple computers together and making them act as a single network segment. It has multiple Input/Output ports. The device is a form of multi port repeater. It is used for broadcasting. Hubs are commonly used to connect segments of a LAN. When a packet arrives at one port, it is copied to the other ports so that all segments of the LAN can see all packets. Suppose 5 computers are connected through a hub. One of them sends a message to another. When the message arrives at the hub, it broadcasts to all the other computers which are connected. The computer for whom the message is sent receives it, while the others simply discard it. Data communications becomes very slow if more number of systems are busy in sending messages at the same time because of collision and data loss.\\n\\nHubs can be two types:\\n\\nActive hubs: These devices not only function as regenerator, but also provide multiple ports for several computers to connect in a network.\\n\\nPassive hubs: These devices only provide multiple ports for several computers to connect to a network.\\n\\nSwitch: It is a device for connecting multiple computers and networks together to form single network segment. The term commonly refers to a multi-port network bridge that.\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\nProcesses and routes data at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model. A switch is a telecommunication device that receives a message from any device connected to it and then transmits the message only to the device for which the message was meant. Do you think switch is more intelligent than a hub? Yes. It is more intelligent than hub because hub simply broadcasts the message to all computers which are connected to it. An eights port switch is shown in Fig 9.10.\\n\\nRepeater\\n\\nRepeaters are used in a network to regenerate digital signals distorted by transmission loss. It has the ability to reconstruct a signal to near its original quality. In a network, a repeater can relay messages between sub networks that use different protocols or cable types. It works similar to amplifier in an analog network. When two computers are connected in a network using cables and the distance is greater than the specification, then to avoid data loss repeaters should be used in between.\\n\\nBridge\\n\\nIt is a device as shown in Fig. 9.11, which connects two networks segments. It basically filters data traffic at a network boundary. Bridges reduce the amount of traffic on a LAN by dividing it into two segments. Bridges inspect incoming traffic and decide whether to forward or discard it based on pre-defined rules.\\n\\nRouter\\n\\nIt is a device that forwards data packets between computer networks. A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks. When a data packet comes in one of the lines, the router reads the address information in the packet to determine its ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table it directs the packet to the next network elements on its journey. It works with IP addresses. A router\\'s image is shown in Fig. 9.12.\\n\\nGateway\\n\\nIt is a device as shown in Fig. 9.13 that connects dissimilar networks. It is an internetworking system capable of joining together two networks that use different base protocols. Depending on the types of protocols they support, network gateways can operate at any level of the OSI model (Refer 9.12.1 section). They are also called as protocol converters and translators. These activities of a gateway are more complex than that of the router or switch, as it communicates using more than one protocol.\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\nSatellite: It is a device that works as a receiver as well as a transmitter. It is fitted with different transponders for communications. It uses microwaves for transmission. These are generally used for mobile applications such as communications to ships, vehicles, planes and hand-held terminals, and for TV and radio broadcasting.\\n\\n9.8 SWITCHING TECHNOLOGIES\\n\\nOne of the major purpose and use of networks is sharing or transfer of information. Do you know how data is transmitted across the network? Well, for this, the switching techniques are used which are explained as under:\\n\\nCircuit switching: In this technique, communication medium is wired. A physical connectivity is established between the source and the destination computer before communication takes place. Messaging takes place one after another in a sequence. The telephone networks are generally based on circuit switching. The circuit or the connection may pass through a number of telephone exchanges in different parts of the country. At each stage the connection remains blocked until a link is made between the two ends. This communication is generally slow.\\n\\nMessage switching: In this technique the message to be sent has no restriction in size and the computers use wireless connectivity between them. However, the traffic is more efficiently handled using the \"store-and-forward\" technique. Unlike circuit switching no physical link is established in it. Here the communication medium is wireless. The messages communicated can vary in size. A message is stored and then forwarded as soon as the destination is free to receive traffic. Messages can be entered regardless of whether the receiving terminal is busy or operational. The queuing of messages and the persistence of automatic dialling leads to better utilisation of lines reducing the call charges.\\n\\nPacket switching: With message switching there is no limit on block size. In contrast, packet switching places a tight limit on the block size. Data is divided in the form of packets stored in the main memory. The packet size is fixed and there is no limit on data. Communication medium is wireless. This type of system was originally designed to provide reliable transmission through a communications network where switches or lines may suddenly become unavailable or alternative routes may have to be chosen. A packet consists of a \"header\" section which contains information such as the network address of the destination terminal, a data section containing the information to be transferred and a \"tail\" section containing checking information. A stream of data is therefore split into a number of packets when these techniques are employed. Packets may vary in length from a few bytes up to several thousand. Once a message has been transmitted, the packets which comprise it may take different routes through the communications system and arrive at the receiver at different times. In this scenario it is up to the receiver to reassemble the packets into the correct order, to obtain the complete message. This is done based on pre-defined identifiers/ headers and rules.\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance 109\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\n9.9 NETWORK TOPOLOGIES\\n\\nNotes This section will introduce you to a number of different network topologies with various types of network architecture. Network architecture is made up of a topology, a cable type, and an access method.\\n\\nA network topology is the physical layout of computers, cables and other components of a network. There are number of network topologies, and a computer network may be built using multiple topologies. Various topologies of networks are given below:\\n\\nBus topology\\n\\nStar topology\\n\\nRing topology\\n\\nMesh topology\\n\\nHybrid topology\\n\\nWireless topology\\n\\nBus topology:\\n\\nThis topology uses one cable as the main trunk to connect all the computers together as shown in Fig. 9.14. It is very easy to set up and requires no additional hardware like hub. The cable is also called the trunk, a backbone, or a segment.\\n\\nWith bus topology, when a computer sends out a signal, the signal travels the cable length in both directions from the source computer. When the signal reaches the end of the cable length, it bounces back and returns in the direction it came from. This is known as signal bounce. If another signal is sent from the opposite direction at the same time, the two signals collide and get destroyed. In such a situation, the signals get retransmitted. It happens till the signals get transmitted to the destination system. For this reason, terminators are placed at both the ends of the trunk.\\n\\nThe terminators are used to absorb the signal when it reaches the end of the trunk. This prevents signal bounce. There are two situations when the network collapses, first when there is no termination, due to signal bounce it happens and second when the cable breaks, even then the network goes down. A bus is a passive topology, which means the signal travels visiting each of the computers one by one without getting regenerated in any way by them. These have no role in functioning of the bus.\\n\\nAdvantages of bus topology:\\n\\nCost is low as it uses short cable lengths and no connecting hardware.\\n\\nInstallation is easy.\\n\\nFailure of a computer does not affect the working of the network.\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\nDisadvantages of bus topology\\n\\nTroubleshooting is difficult - fault isolation and diagnosis is difficult.\\n\\nBreaking of the trunk collapses the network.\\n\\nIt is not very scalable (easy to extend).\\n\\nStar topology\\n\\nIn this topology, all the computers are connected through a central device known as hub or a switch as shown in figure 9.15. Each computer is connected to the hub, using a separate cable.\\n\\nAdvantages of star topology:\\n\\nEasy to troubleshoot and isolate problems.\\n\\nCable failure affects only a single computer.\\n\\nEasily scalable.\\n\\nFig. 9.15 Star topology\\n\\nDisadvantages of a star topology\\n\\nRequires long cable length.\\n\\nA single connecting device allows for a single point failure.\\n\\nInstallation is difficult.\\n\\nRing topology\\n\\nIn this topology, all the computers are connected via a cable that loops in a ring or circle as shown in fig 9.16. It has no start and no end. Because there are no ends, terminators are not necessary in a ring topology. Signals travel in one direction on a ring. Here each computer contributes to the network by regenerating the signal.\\n\\nAdvantages of a ring topology\\n\\nCable faults are easily located, making troubleshooting easier.\\n\\nInstallation is easy.\\n\\nSignal retransmission not required as it gets regenerated often.\\n\\nFig. 9.16 Ring topology\\n\\nDisadvantages of a ring topology\\n\\nA single break in the cable can disrupt the entire network.\\n\\nExpansion is not easy.\\n\\nIt is not very scalable.\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\nMesh topology\\n\\nIt is not very common in computer networking today. In a mesh topology, every computer has a connection to every other computer of the network.\\n\\nAdvantages of mesh topology\\n\\nProvides multiple paths between computers. So even if one cable link breaks, communication takes place using the other links.\\n\\nNetwork can be easily expanded.\\n\\nDisadvantages of a mesh topology\\n\\nRequires much more cable length than any other topologies.\\n\\nInstallation is difficult.\\n\\nHybrid topology\\n\\nIt is a mixture of the topologies discussed so far. A very popular hybrid topology is a star-bus topology, in which a number of star topologies are connected by a central bus. Another very popular topology is a star-ring topology. It looks like a star that acts like a ring.\\n\\nWireless topology\\n\\nA wireless topology is one in which few cables are used to connect the computers. The network is made up of transmitters that broadcast the packets using radio frequencies. The network contains special transmitters called cells or access points which extend a radio sphere in the shape of a bubble around the transmitter. It can extend to multiple rooms and possibly floors in a building. The computers and network devices have a special transmitter-receiver, which allows them to receive broadcasts and transmit requested data back to the access point as shown in fig 9.17. The access point is connected to the physical network by a cable, which allows communicating with systems on the wired network.\\n\\nAdvantages of a wireless topology\\n\\nAllows wireless remote access.\\n\\nNetwork can be easily expanded.\\n\\nDisadvantages of a wireless topology\\n\\nPotential security issues.\\n\\nLimited transmission speed.\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 9.2\\n\\nChoose the correct answer:\\n\\nRepeater is ....................\\n\\n(i) regenerater of a signal\\n\\n(ii) network connector\\n\\n(iii) wave\\n\\n(iv) software\\n\\nRouter is a device used to connect a ....................\\n\\n(i) LAN to LAN\\n\\n(ii) WAN to WAN\\n\\n(iii) LAN to WAN\\n\\n(iv) None of these\\n\\n9.10 NETWORK MODELS\\n\\nThere are two important network models: OSI and TCP/IP models. These two models will explain you about how communication between computers takes place.\\n\\n9.10.1 The OSI Network Model\\n\\nOpen Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model, developed by ISO (International Standards Organization) for understanding data communications between any two networked systems.\\n\\nAn OSI model is a conceptual seven layer architecture where each layer is considered to be responsible for a task of the communication session between two computers. It got introduced in the late 1970s. The layers are arranged here from the lower levels starting with the physical (hardware) to the higher levels. OSI Model comprises of seven layers. Suppose, computer A wants to send some message to computer B. At computer A, some task will take place before it is transmitted. Starting from layer 7, every layer from top to bottom, till layer 1 will do their respective job on the message and finally layer 7 i.e. the physical layer will do the transmission in the form of bits. The message is in its raw form when it reaches the destination computer B, it gets operated by all the seven layers but\\n\\nFig. 9.18 OSI Model\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\nin the reverse order i.e. from layer 1 to layer 7. Finally layer 7 will be responsible to get back the message into its original form to be read at the destination computer.\\n\\nNotes A summary of the function of each layer is given in the Fig. 9.18.\\n\\n9.10.2 TCP/IP Network Model\\n\\nThis model describes a set of communication protocols that implement the protocol dependencies on which the Internet and most commercial networks run. The TCP/IP network model has four basic layers: Application layer, Transport layer, Internet layer and Link layer.\\n\\nLink layer (layer 1): Deals with all physical components of network connectivity between the network and the IP protocol.\\n\\nInternet layer (layer 2): The work in this layer is managed by IP. It contains all functionality that manage the movement of data between two network devices over a routed network.\\n\\nTransport layer (layer 3): The work in this layer is managed by TCP. It manages the flow of traffic between two hosts or devices, ensuring that data arrives at the application on the host for which it is targeted.\\n\\nApplication layer (layer 4): Acts as final endpoint at either end of a communication session between two network hosts.\\n\\nNow, let us know more on TCP and IP protocols.\\n\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\n\\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) supports the network at the transport layer. It provides a reliable connection oriented service. Connection oriented means both the client and server must open the connection before data is sent.\\n\\nTCP provides:\\n\\nEnd to end reliability.\\n\\nData packet re-sequencing.\\n\\nFlow control.\\n\\nInternet Protocol\\n\\nInternet Protocol (IP) is responsible for exchanging information between routers so that routers can select the proper path for network traffic, while IP provides the method of distributed data in packets. Thus it can distribute packets to a destination via different routes and can handle congestion.\\n\\nIP provides for:\\n\\nAddressing.\\n\\nType of service specification.\\n\\nFragmentation and re-assembly.\\n\\nSecurity.\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\n9.13 NETWORK PROTOCOLS\\n\\nA protocol means the rules that govern the communication process between two computers in a network. It defines standardized formats for data packets and techniques for identifying errors. You have already learnt about TCP/IP protocol in the previous section. Some other common protocols are being explained below:\\n\\nEthernet: Provides transport of information between physical locations on UTP cable. Data is passed in packets.\\n\\nSLIP: Serial Line IP, a form of data encapsulation for serial lines.\\n\\nPPP: Point to Point Protocol is a form of serial line data encapsulation that is an improvement over SLIP.\\n\\nICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol is a message control and error reporting protocol between a host server and a gateway to the Internet.\\n\\nSNMP: Simple Network Management Protocol, is used to manage all types of network elements based on various data, sent and received.\\n\\nHTTP: Hyper Text Transmission Protocol is an application-level protocol intended for distributed, collaborative and hypermedia information system. It has various built-in request methods which allow users to read and save a web page.\\n\\nFTP: File Transfer Protocol allows secure file transfer between two computers with login required.\\n\\nSMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is a protocol that governs the e-mail system in a computer network.\\n\\nEach protocol ultimately has its data packets wrapped in an ethernet, SLIP, or PPP packet (at the link level) in order to be sent over the UTP cable. Some protocol data packets are wrapped sequentially multiple times before being sent. For example, FTP data is wrapped in a TCP packet which is wrapped in an IP packet, which is wrapped in a link packet (normally ethernet).\\n\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\n\\nIn this lesson, you have learnt the fundamentals of computer networking, the communication channels, topologies and layers of computer network models.\\n\\nSome major points to remember:\\n\\nNetwork can be defined as an interconnection of multiple computers.\\n\\nInternet is a public network across the globe governed by TCP/IP protocol.\\n\\nBus topology does not need a hub but expansion is much easier.\\n\\nStar topology provides a better reliability as a collapsed system will not affect the rest of the computers connected in the network.\\n\\nNetwork Basics\\n\\nA hub is a device used to connect several computers together.\\n\\nA switch is a device that works as an intelligent hub. It filters the message to the intended computer.\\n\\nA repeater is a device that regenerates a signal and joins two LANs of same protocol.\\n\\nA bridge is a device that joins two LANs.\\n\\nA router connects a LAN to a WAN. It does the work of routing.\\n\\nNetwork Card also known as NIC is used to connect a computer to a network.\\n\\nNetwork topology is the physical layout of computers, cables and other components of a network.\\n\\nA protocol means the rules that govern the communication process between two computers in a network.\\n\\nTERMINAL EXERCISE\\n\\nState the benefits of a computer network.\\n\\nWhat is internet?

At the point when something does not work, reinstall the appropriate driver.\\n\\n11.4 SOFTWARE TROUBLESHOOTING\\n\\nUpdate softwares\\n\\nOne general guideline to remember while doing programming related troubleshooting is to verify you have the latest adaptations of your applications, drivers and working framework. Additionally install good anti-virus software which automatically scans and cleans your computer as and when required.\\n\\nThe softwares you were using might be an old version. Check the current version and download application patches. Recently launched applications may have bugs. When the application developer or product maker gets to know about some bug in the application, they develops and posts patches, fixes, and administration packs on its site to rectify the same. When you have programs that contain bugs, check the site of your product maker - they may have posted the fix you require. You should download the patch(es) and install them on your computer.\\n\\nPreliminary Measures\\n\\nWhen you have any problem with your computer, the first thing you need to do is to restart the machine but before restarting please save your files (word, excel etc.).\\n\\nReinstall\\n\\nIf a specific program/software starts working in an unexpected manner (or) is not working properly even after a few attempts, reinstalling the particular program/software is required. Before re-installing a software, you have to uninstall it (through Control Panel → Add / Remove Programs).\\n\\nProblem Diagnosis, Troubleshooting and Maintenance\\n\\nEliminate Troublesome Programs\\n\\nIf you notice that consistent problems began after you installed a particular software, then uninstall and re-install the software. If the problems arise again then either uninstall the software permanently (if you think that the software is unnecessary), or contact the software developer to get the issue resolved.\\n\\nDefragment the Hard Drive\\n\\nAfter a machine has been utilized for some time, the files on the hard disk get fragmented. We do not get to know about this fragmentation because we always get the correct data from the files. But fragmentation slows down the performance of the hard drive. Therefore, you should periodically defragment your hard disks. Defragmentation software is usually supplied as a utility with the operating system.\\n\\nFormatting Your Hard Disk (HDD)\\n\\nIn the extreme situation, you may need to format your hard disk, and reinstall your operating system, drivers, and programs from scratch. This is the situation when machines have been hit by specific sorts of viruses. When you format your hard disk drive, everything will be permanently deleted. Before formatting you can take the important files/data into an external hard / flash drive by connecting it through USB port on your CPU via USB cable.\\n\\n11.5 NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING\\n\\nYou have learnt hardware troubleshooting and software troubleshooting. Now let us know about network troubleshooting.\\n\\nWhen you are working in the network computers, sometimes you may not be able to access network files or unable to connect the network. In this situation you follow these steps.\\n\\nCheck to see if the network cable is plugged, if not then plug it.\\n\\nCheck to see if the light is blinking when the network cable is plugged.\\n\\nCheck to see if username, password and domain are entered correctly.\\n\\nRe-enter new username, password and domain and try again.\\n\\nIf you still get an error message then check the login credentials on other PCs, if it works correctly then the problem is solved.\\n\\nIf it does not work on other PC then your login credentials could be incorrect. Otherwise your PC network hardware has to be checked.\\n\\nBasic Network Troubleshooting Tools\\n\\nPinging\\n\\nPing command - to check the reachability of the host on an Internet protocol. i.e., to verify that computer can communicate with other computer (device) on the network.

It secures the data from being lost or altered either intentionally or unintentionally. Also it ensures that no unauthorized person can access your data.\\n\\nEncryption (system level security)\\n\\nMost tools encrypt the information kept in the secret word document. Encryption guarantees that no matter even if the data could be accessed by unknown person, the intruder will not have the right to use the passwords in the document. Most tools perform one-way encryption of passwords.\\n\\nData Access: Protecting Your Data\\n\\nWhen you are working alone on a PC, you do not have to think about access controls. When you start to work on a system that supports various clients or is in network, you will need to be careful over information security and access controls. You may not need each client to have the right to use your records or documents.\\n\\nNetwork Level Security\\n\\nA small flaw in the network can result in major financial damage or loss of sensitive data. Network security consists of authorization of data access in network. Users are assigned authenticated information which permits them access to information and programs based on permissions.\\n\\nFirewall enforces access policies for e.g., services which will be allowed for access by the network users. Intrusion detection and prevention system helps in detecting such intrusions. Networks are prone to attacks from malicious sources. Network attacks can be of two types: Passive attack (attempts to make use of information from the system) and Active attack (modify system resources or affect their operation). Tools are to be used for preventing the intrusion on networks.\\n\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\n\\nAfter going through this lesson, you have learnt about how to recover your system, features of control panel, how to troubleshoot hardware, software and network.

With increase in usage of internet connectivity and need of high end computing, today\\'s world is witnessing a shift from the era of mainframe computing and individual computing to a new era of mobile and green computing where the computing power, software and data are not necessarily located in office premises, rather, these can be stored somewhere in a \"cloud\" and can be accessed via internet at anytime and anywhere.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nAfter reading this lesson, you will be able to:\\n\\ndefine virtualization.\\n\\nlist the types of computing.\\n\\ndescribe cloud computing.\\n\\nexplain mobile computing.\\n\\nexplore grid computing.\\n\\nuse green computing.\\n\\n12.1 VIRTUALIZATION\\n\\nLiteral meaning of virtualization is simulation. Virtualization allows the pooling and sharing of the computational power (processor, server) and storage of multiple computers, network and other resources among multiple users. This simulation technique is adopted.\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nto give user a feel that all infrastructure (whether hardware or software) belong to user only. This is achieved by simulating the computational facility by creating a virtual version of given resource like for hardware platform virtual version of storage device, network resources can be made, and for software platform virtual version of operating system and other software is created. This virtual version provides a complete execution environment. An user is able to interact with these virtual resources as if it were a real single logical resource.\\n\\nA concept of virtualization can be made clear with a common example of division of hard disk into different partitions. A partition is a logical division of a hard disk and it creates an effect of two separate hard disks to the user. This partition makes the management of files easier.\\n\\nVirtualization is the ability to create a virtual copy of a device or some type of resource like server, storage, device, network and even operating system, etc. It divides the multiple resources into different execution environments. Thus, one of the main objectives of virtualization is to centralize administrative tasks while improving scalability and workloads.\\n\\n12.1.1 Architecture\\n\\nVirtualization can be achieved at different levels. If you consider hardware, the organization needs:\\n\\nA large data storage system where complete data of an organization can be kept with complete security. Further, there should be a secured and reliable intra department access to database as per the policy.\\n\\nA high end server that can retrieve the data from the storage and process it with fast speed.\\n\\nA fast and reliable internet connectivity.\\n\\nAll these are required with an objective that the process is completed almost at the same instant the user has entered the necessary input data. As discussed earlier it is not possible to provide dedicated resources to each user, however we can give an illusion of dedicated resource through virtualization. Let\\'s see how the server, network and storage virtualization is done.\\n\\n12.1.2 Server Virtualization\\n\\nIt is a partition of a physical server into smaller virtual server. i.e., logically server resources were divided into multiple copies. The idea is to present the illusion of one huge machine that looks like many machines or multiple machines tied together to look like a single system.\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nPerceived Seiver\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nNetwork Layer\\n\\nVirtualization Layer\\n\\nHardware Layer\\n\\nPhysical Servers\\n\\nFig. 12.1 Server Virtualization\\n\\n12.1.3 Network Virtualization\\n\\nThe bandwidth available in the network environment is much more than is needed for a single user. Thus, for complete utilization of this bandwidth, it is required to partition the available bandwidth into channels, each of which is independent from the other and each of which can be assigned to a particular server or device in real time.\\n\\nData Center\\n\\nNew York Los Angeles Atlanta VLAN 1 VLAN 2 VLAN 3 VLAN 4 VLAN 5 VLAN 6 VLAN 7 VLAN 7 VLAN 7\\n\\nFig. 12.2 Network Virtualization\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\n155\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\n12.1.4 Storage Virtualization\\n\\nThis is perhaps the most widely deployed and highly used virtualization practice. Storage virtualization allows separate storage devices to be combined into a perceived single unit. Storage virtualization attempts to maximize the efficiency of storage devices in information architecture.\\n\\nPerceived Storage Device Virtualization Layer Physical Storage Device Fig. 12.3 Storage Virtualization Fig. 12.3 Storage Virtualization\\n\\n12.1.5 Software Virtualization\\n\\nOperating system virtualization is to allow a piece of hardware to run multiple operating system images at the same time. It helps to accommodate multiple platforms simultaneously providing user more flexibility. Application software virtualization leads to create a logical image of application software to the user.\\n\\nA system that provides both virtualizations of hardware as well as software is referred to as Universal Virtualization, as shown below:\\n\\nApplication Layer Virtualization Layer Hardware Layer Fig. 12.4 Universal Virtualization\\n\\n156\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nAdvantages of Virtualization\\n\\nImproved hardware utilization: As the same resource is used by many users, utilization of resources is increased.\\n\\nLesser hardware cost: You need lesser number of hardware resources, thus overall cost is reduced.\\n\\nIncreased operational agility and reduced downtime: As more alternative resources are available, the system does not crash even if any one component goes out of order.\\n\\nAs lesser resources are needed, this approach is considered to be more environment-friendly.\\n\\nLower total cost of ownership.\\n\\nIt improves overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system.\\n\\nIncreased network capacity: channelizing the network increases the transmission capacity.\\n\\nDisadvantages of Virtualization\\n\\nThe various advantages of virtualization can be appreciated only if these benefits are achieved without compromising the overall security, reliability and availability of the IT infrastructure.\\n\\nThe virtualized environment is considered more vulnerable as there are more chances of potential attack to gain unauthorized access to resources from guest operating systems.\\n\\n12.2 CLOUD COMPUTING\\n\\nAs virtualization allows the user to access any resource by simulating a logical version of it, this technology gave an idea if you need any particular facility only for say one hour a day then why to pay for it for whole day or why to maintain the complete infrastructure if you can get this facility just by creating a logical version of it. Keeping these objectives in mind the idea of pay-per-use services was implemented through cloud computing.\\n\\nCloud computing in simple words refers to selling any type of IT services including:\\n\\ndelivery of resources via creating a virtual simulation of the resource.\\n\\nselling of application software.\\n\\nplatform on which we need to execute the application;\\n\\nAll of these services are delivered through internet.\\n\\nCloud services allow individuals and businesses to use software and hardware that are managed by third parties at some remote locations. Examples of cloud services include online file storage, social networking sites, webmail, and online business.\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\napplications. Thus, through cloud computing, one can increase its storage capacity, usage of high end server or add computational capabilities without investing in new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software.\\n\\nThe cloud computing model allows access to information and computer resources from anywhere where a network connection is available. Cloud computing provides a shared pool of resources, including data storage space, networks, computer processing power, and specialized corporate and user applications. Cloud computing encompasses any subscription-based or pay-per-use service, that too, in real time over the Internet, thereby it extends existing IT capabilities of any organization by letting organization to pay just for the service it needs. The best feature of cloud computing is that it provides the end user many flexibilities like:\\n\\nAnything (i.e., any IT related service)\\n\\nAnywhere (at any place via internet)\\n\\nAnytime (at any instant of time)\\n\\nWith any device that is compatible with internet usage\\n\\nThe following definition of cloud computing has been developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):\\n\\n“Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.”\\n\\n12.2.1 Essential Characteristics\\n\\nThe five essential characteristics that should be there in a computing environment so that it can be considered as cloud computing are:\\n\\nOn-demand self service\\n\\nBroad network access\\n\\nResource pooling\\n\\nRapid elasticity\\n\\nMeasured service.\\n\\nOn-demand Self-service: As a user can request and manage your own computing resources as per your need i.e., the user can choose the computing capabilities, such as server time, network bandwidth, storage capacity etc. These requests are fulfilled automatically without requiring human interaction.\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nBroad Network Access\\n\\nYou can access the given service over the internet or private network. Thus it is required that all cloud services should be always available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs).\\n\\nResource Pooling\\n\\nPooled resources mean that user can select any resource from a pool of computing resources. Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, network bandwidth, and virtual machines. The cloud service provider need pool all computing resources to serve multiple users using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources. These resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned according to user demand. The user generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or data centre). Thus, for the end user, resource usage is independent of its location.\\n\\nRapid Elasticity\\n\\nThe services, which are provided, can be rapidly and elastically changed. To the user all these services are available and can choose any one of them. It should appear to the user that all services are unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at anytime from anywhere.\\n\\nMeasured Service\\n\\nCloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability according to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts) i.e., the service provider will charge the user as per the usage of IT services. Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported providing transparency for both the service provider and user who are utilizing the service. The resource service which is provided can be scaled larger or smaller; and according to the use of a service (type of service and amount of time which this service is used, also on number of user) the customers are billed.\\n\\nYou can say, through cloud computing, service provider provide access to software, platform or infrastructure on a basis of demand raised by user and user has to pay for it on a metered basis.\\n\\n12.2.2 Three Services\\n\\nThe cloud computing can be accessed for usage of any particular software, platform or the complete infrastructure. Based on these the following three services are characterized:\\n\\nCloud Software as a Service (SaaS)\\n\\nThis service provides user a capability to use any applications (which are developed by service provider) by executing it on a cloud infrastructure i.e., any pre-made application, along with the required software, operating system, hardware and network, is provided by the service provider. The applications are accessible from various client devices through Internet via a thin client interface such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email). The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nExamples: Many of the most popular cloud-based applications are business productivity tools such as email (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail), online productivity software (e.g., Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365), conferencing services (e.g., Microsoft LiveMeeting, WebEx), and customer relationship management software (e.g., Salesforce).\\n\\nCloud Platform as a Service (PaaS):\\n\\nThis service provides user a capability to deploy user-created or acquired applications onto the cloud infrastructure. This application is created using programming languages and tools supported by the cloud service provider. Thus cloud service provider provides an operating system, hardware, and network where the user installs or develops their own software and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.\\n\\nExamples: Google App Engine allows developers to create and run web applications that run on top of a custom Google platform and use Google\\'s computing resources.\\n\\nCloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):\\n\\nThis service provides user a provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources, such that, the user is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. Thus IaaS model provides just the hardware and network, and the user can install operating systems, software and applications. Although here also user does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and possibly limited control of selected networking components (e.g., host firewalls).\\n\\nExamples: cloud storage (e.g., Data centres), providing users access to scalable online storage.\\n\\n12.2.3 Cloud computing Deployment Models\\n\\nThere are four different ways through which a cloud computing can be deployed:\\n\\nPrivate Cloud:\\n\\nThe cloud infrastructure is used exclusively by an organization. These are usually used by large organizations which have multiple business units. It may be managed by the organization itself or by some other third party. It can be deployed either in premises (on-site) or off premises (off site).\\n\\nCommunity Cloud:\\n\\nThe cloud infrastructure is shared exclusively by a specific group of organizations, especially those, sharing common concern (e.g., business interest, mission or goal, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). Similar to private cloud, it may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.\\n\\nPublic Cloud:\\n\\nThe cloud infrastructure is made available for the use to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services. Examples of public clouds are Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Google, Microsoft Azure etc.\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nHybrid Cloud\\n\\nThe cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., “cloud bursting” for “load-balancing” between clouds).\\n\\nAdvantages of Cloud Computing\\n\\nIt creates a more flexible environment that allows organizations to \"rent\" computing power on requirement.\\n\\nAn organization can scale up or down its IT usage, according to demand.\\n\\nNo need to procure space for creating infrastructure.\\n\\nProvide more mobile solution i.e., it is not necessary for the user to be in office to access the information. He or she can access the information through mobile also.\\n\\nOrganization can build its infrastructure on its actual use of IT resources, rather than creating an overbuilt capacity, based on potential demand. Potential demands can be met by renting services through cloud.\\n\\nOrganizations can easily upgrade their applications as they can change platforms simply by switching cloud service providers.\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 12.1\\n\\n................ allows the pooling and sharing of resources among multiple users.\\n\\nWhich of the following is not an essential characteristic of cloud computing.\\n\\n(a) On demand self service.\\n\\n(b) Static environment.\\n\\n(c) Resource pooling.\\n\\n(d) Rapid elasticity.\\n\\n12.3 MOBILE COMPUTING\\n\\nThe advancement in technology of portable computers, which are capable of accessing the wireless technology, has made a huge revolution in the domain of Information and Communication Technology. It has given birth to a new era of mobile computing, a platform that allows mobile users to have versatile communication with other people and notification of events, messages and allows continuous access to services and resources of land-based network.\\n\\nMobile computing is an umbrella term used for describing the technologies that enable people to access network services any place, any time, and anywhere. It is an extension of mobile voice communication technology which is capable of sending and receiving data across the cellular network.\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\n161\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nMobile computing basically involves designing of application and resolving technical issues of the people who are on move around within a region or country, or travel between countries and continents. Mobile data communication has become a very important and rapidly evolving technology as it allows users to transmit data from remote locations to other remote or fixed locations. This proves to be the solution to the biggest problem of business people who are frequently on the move.\\n\\nIn simple terms Mobile computing can be defined as a computing environment over physical mobility.\\n\\nOR\\n\\n“A technology that allows transmission of data, via a computer, without having to be connected to a fixed physical link.”\\n\\nOR\\n\\n“Mobile computing is the ability to use computing capability without a pre-defined location and/or connection to a network to publish and/or subscribe to information.”\\n\\nHere you need a computing environment which is mobile and moves along with the user. For that you need a computing environment which fulfils the three important needs namely:\\n\\nWireless communication\\n\\nMobility\\n\\nPortability\\n\\nWireless Communication:\\n\\nIn mobile computing platform, information between processing units flows through wireless channels. The demand for mobile communication creates the need for integration of wireless networks and existing fixed networks.\\n\\nLocal Area Networks:\\n\\nstandardization of IEEE 802.11 or HIPERLAN for handling interoperability and issues between different wireless LANs.\\n\\nWide Area Networks:\\n\\nGSM and ISDN for global access.\\n\\nInternet: Mobile IP extension of the Internet protocol (IP).\\n\\nCommon technologies used are IR (Infrared Receivers), BlueTooth, W-LANs, Cellular, W-Packet Data networks, SAT. etc.\\n\\nMobility:\\n\\nMobile computing needs that device should be able to remain connected with network while changing its location. Different aspects of mobility are:\\n\\nUser Mobility: users communicate “any time, anywhere, with anyone” (example: read/write email on web browser).\\n\\nDevice Mobility: a small battery driven devices that can be connected any time, anywhere to the network.\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nSession Mobility\\n\\nA user session should be able to move from one user-agent environment to another.\\n\\nService Mobility\\n\\nUser should be able to move from one service to another.\\n\\nPortability\\n\\nIt is not feasible to carry a desktop because of its size, weight and heat dissipation. You need a portable device that is small, light weighted, durable, capable to be operational under wide environmental conditions and having a battery with long life.\\n\\nMobile Computing Environment\\n\\nTo develop a mobile computing environment, you need a wireless communication facility, a mobile PC or mobile device and software which is specially designed keeping the needs of mobile device and user of mobile device.\\n\\nMobile Data Communication\\n\\nWhenever a user is using a mobile, he / she will be using different networks at different places at different times as discussed earlier. Some common examples are GSM, CDMA, Ethernet, Wireless LAN, Bluetooth etc.\\n\\nWireless Access Services\\n\\nMobile laptop and notebook computers can use one of two types of wireless access services when away from the home or office. The most commonly used and least expensive is Wireless Fidelity also known as WiFi. The WiFi uses radio waves to broadcast an Internet signal from a wireless router to the immediate surrounding area. An alternative to WiFi is cellular broadband. This type of mobile computing technology utilizes a cellular modem to connect to cell towers for Internet access.\\n\\nMobile Device\\n\\nMobile telephony took off with the introduction of cellular technology which allowed the efficient utilization of frequencies, enabling the connection of a large number of users. There are many different types of mobile computing devices designed to make it easier to travel and conveniently access technology on the go. Notebooks are small laptop computers that typically feature built-in wireless networking, and are great choices for those who want to work even while travelling. Mobile computing devices with a smaller size, such as smart phones or tablet computers, are becoming very popular as they are much easier to carry and now-a-days, these devices include many advanced features of computing, even comparable to those found on a laptop computer.\\n\\nCommon Devices Used in Mobile Computing\\n\\nNotebook PCs\\n\\nPersonal digital assistant/enterprise digital assistant\\n\\nSmartphone\\n\\nTablet computer\\n\\nUltra-Mobile PC\\n\\nWearable computer\\n\\nPalmtops\\n\\nCell phones\\n\\nPagers\\n\\nSensors\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nMobile Software:\\n\\nMobile applications commonly called mobile apps are the applications that run on a mobile device. These usually run on web browser (HTML, JavaScript, Flash, server-side components, etc). Designing software of mobile application is a challenging task.\\n\\nOne of the major constraint is that user of this technology demands intuitive user interfaces, fast response times, and deep relevant content, high processing (specially for gaming and multimedia application) but the device which are used for mobile applications usually have limited processing speed, storage, power backup and display facilities.\\n\\nMobile computing is widely used in:\\n\\nVehicles: use of GPS in vehicles for identifying the area.\\n\\nNomadic User: user usually uses laptop and connects to network.\\n\\nSmart mobile phone: widely used for playing games, up-to date information, e-mail facility.\\n\\nInvisible computing, Wearable computing:\\n\\nThese are tiny embedded \"computers\" that can be worn by the user as an accessory and use Bluetooth over cable connections, for providing connectivity.\\n\\nIntelligent house or office: Using mobile computing control various functions of computers and embedded systems that are used in office or home.\\n\\nVarious common usage of this computing are:\\n\\nFinding a local printer in the office even without being physically plugged.\\n\\nHouse recognizes inhabitants.\\n\\nHouse regulates temperature according to the need of person by adjusting the temperature of AC which can be achieved even without entering the house.\\n\\nMeeting Room/Conference:\\n\\nShare data instantly, send a message to someone else in the room or secretly vote on controversial issues.\\n\\nTaxi/Police/Fire Squad Fleet:\\n\\nUse this computing facility for remaining connected, for controlling and communicating.\\n\\nEmergency Services:\\n\\nReceived information regarding the address, type and other details of an incident can be dispatched quickly, via a CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data) system using mobile computers, to one or several appropriate mobile units which are in the vicinity of the incident.\\n\\nDisaster Relief:\\n\\nAfter earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption, etc. infrastructure cannot be established immediately but mobile communication is established via Satellite or Ad-Hoc network and proves very advantageous for relief and early transmission of patient data to hospital.\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nDisaster Alarm:\\n\\nWith help of satellite communication and sensors one might be able to alarm disaster early Example: Tsunami.\\n\\nMilitary / Security:\\n\\ncan be widely used during war for communication and controlling the weapons in real time environment.\\n\\nAdvantages of Mobile Computing\\n\\nAs devices used in mobile computing are portable, it can be easily carried by the user. Hence it provides an opportunity to develop an environment, where user always has a computing facility.\\n\\nAs these devices have Internet access, these provide the user a facility to seek any information at any time.\\n\\nThese devices are typically GPS enabled.\\n\\nUsually devices are multimedia enabled and typically have cameras & microphones.\\n\\nApps are free or low-cost.\\n\\nDisadvantages of Mobile Computing\\n\\nThe following are not exactly disadvantages; rather these are some of the limitations of mobile computing:\\n\\nLimited screen size.\\n\\nLimited battery life.\\n\\nLimited processor speed.\\n\\nLimited and sometimes slow network access.\\n\\nLimited or awkward input: soft keyboard, phone keypad, touch screen, or stylus.\\n\\nLimited web browser functionality.\\n\\nRange of platforms & configurations across devices.\\n\\n12.4 GRID COMPUTING\\n\\nGrid computing applies the resources of numerous computers in a network to work on a single problem at the same time. Usually this environment is used for solving large scientific or technical problem where huge amount of computing is involved. A large project is divided among multiple computers to make use of their resources. However, in cloud computing, small applications run on different systems, simultaneously. Enables communities (“virtual organizations”) to share geographically distributed resources as they pursue common goals.\\n\\nThe prime objective of grid computing are:\\n\\n- Sharing computing resources between organisations.\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nSolving complex and other software applications that demand high computing by providing widespread access to powerful computers and storage.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n“A computational grid is a hardware and software infrastructure that provides dependable, consistent, pervasive, and inexpensive access to high-end computational facilities”.\\n\\nAs explained in the beginning of the lesson, this decade has emphasized on community learning, which use to develop a low cost high performance computing system, popularly called clusters. These clusters share their resources to overcome the resource related problems in application domains. Grid is an infrastructure that involves the integration of different application such that they collaborate with each other to get complex problem solved with an ease. It involves integration of various resources of computers, networks, database and scientific instruments, owned and managed by multiple organizations. This is an environment which provides a secure resource sharing across organizational boundaries i.e., through intra cluster communications.\\n\\nSolving complex problems can be achieved through grid computing by:\\n\\nSimulation of large complex systems.\\n\\nLarge scale multi site data mining, distributed data sets.\\n\\nSharing the resources by simulating their virtual version.\\n\\nInteractive collaboration.\\n\\nReal-time access to remote resources.\\n\\nGrid resources are registered within one or more grid information services. The end users submit their application requirements to the Grid brokers, who then discover the suitable resources, by querying the information services, schedules the application jobs for execution on these resources and then monitors their processing until they are complete. Software tools and services, providing these capabilities to link computing facilities and data sources in order to support distributed analysis and collaborations, are collectively known as grid middleware.\\n\\nCommon grid applications are:\\n\\nDistributed supercomputing\\n\\nHigh-throughput computing\\n\\nOn-demand computing\\n\\nData-intensive computing\\n\\nCollaborative computing\\n\\nAdvantages of Grid Computing\\n\\nCost effective way to utilize the given amount of computing resources by:\\n\\n- Virtualizing resources across an enterprise.\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nEnabling collaboration of all virtual resources across the organizations or community.\\n\\nIdentifying the underutilized resources.\\n\\nPerforming load balancing of resources so that all resources are used equally.\\n\\n12.5 GREEN COMPUTING\\n\\nPopularity of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has increased among common man and the hardware devices used in it have become an integral part of daily routine activities. Hence, it is very important to analyse the impact of this technology on the environment. Also, to make an attempt to develop a system which is environment friendly. The relationship of ICTs and the environment is studied in terms of three distinct kinds of effects:\\n\\nDirect Effects: This effect includes issues related to environmental changes that arise because of the design, production, distribution, maintenance and disposal of ICT goods and services.\\n\\nIndirect Effects: This effect includes issues related to environmental changes that arise because of the application and use of ICTs in different domains of society.\\n\\nSystemic Effects: This effect includes issues related to environmental changes that arise because of the changes in economic and social structures due to use of ICT products and services.\\n\\nImpact of computer on environment needs to be studied from its manufacturing to its usage and disposal stages. As thousands of computers are used in every domain of life, great amount of power is used and a great amount of both paper and electronic wastes are produced.\\n\\nCommon hazards that arise as result of massive usage of computers and other computing devices in our life are:\\n\\nComputers and office equipment play an increasingly large role in energy consumption. Desktop computers, fan, screen savers, scanners and other electronic technology account for the fastest growing source of energy consumption. Even in presently, people do not use energy saving CRT and processor. Further, they keep the computer \"ON\" even when not in use and also do not adopt power saving strategies such as \\'sleep\\' and \\'standby\\' modes. As a result, such a system remains active 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\\n\\nPossible solution:\\n\\nAll computers in offices or home or any organization should have:\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\n167\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\n2. Paper usage:\\n\\nEventhough it is believed that using an automated system will reduce the paper work in any organization but practically it is observed that it has increased the paper consumption as\\n\\nprinting is often wasteful\\n\\nIt is common practice that the people take print outs of emails or meeting agendas\\n\\nprinting out partial drafts\\n\\nmaintain a hardcopy backup of entire data which often becomes obsolete once data changes\\n\\nPossible Solutions:\\n\\nDo not print unless not very urgent\\n\\nAwareness should be provided to the users that all information is stored in the computer and can be retrieved any time hence they need not maintain a hardcopy backup of every partial drafts also\\n\\n3. Manufacturing and packing of computing devices:\\n\\nPollution is increased because there are toxic chemicals used in the manufacturing of computers and components\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nmanufacturers should use non toxic and recyclable material for manufacturing the products\\n\\n4. Disposal of unused devices:\\n\\nThe hardware technology changes very fast and as a result often people feel to replace their existing system. Disposal of these devices constitutes 20-50 million tons per year (about 5% of the total waste of the planet). This waste is also known as e-waste. The improper disposal of computers and components may lead to entry of these toxic material in our food chain and water\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nproper reuse and recycling of the products.\\n\\nReuse: Organizations like play way schools, libraries etc may not need a high end latest configuration system, and instead of disposing the entire system, one can donate a computer or even its components to organizations who need lesser quality computers\\n\\nRefurbish: Rather than discarding the computer completely on release of the next generation. One can even upgrade the system by just replacing the processor and memory chips. Hence, many components like monitor, cables, UPS, speakers, keyboard, mouse etc., can be used (i.e., need not be replaced). This results in upgrading of computing facility without increasing the e-waste.\\n\\nRecycle: The companies that can recycle the plastics and other components, can also recycle the e-waste components.\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nThe prime objective of green computing is study and practice of environmentally sustainable computing through Information Technology.\\n\\nThe objectives of green computing are similar to green chemistry i.e.,\\n\\nIt should reduce the usage of hazardous materials for manufacturing any product.\\n\\nEnhance the energy efficiency of any product by reducing the power consumption of that product.\\n\\nPromote the recyclability.\\n\\nUsage of biodegradable products and factory waste.\\n\\nMany corporate IT departments have taken lot of green computing initiatives to reduce the environmental impact. Green ICT and its services present opportunities to deliver low carbon footprints and mitigate carbon emissions because of the unique ability to make energy consumption and green house gas emissions visible through its products and services.\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 12.2\\n\\n..................... computing allows transmission of data via computer without having to be connected to a fixed physical link.\\n\\nSolving complex problems can be achieved through ..................... computing.\\n\\nPrime objective of ..................... computing is study and practice of environmentally sustainable computing through Information Technology.\\n\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\n\\nIn this lesson you have got familiarized with recent trends and future world of IT.

You have also learnt that advantages, disadvantages and future prospects of these technologies.\\n\\nSome of the keypoints to remember\\n\\nVirtualization allows pooling and sharing of the computational power and storage of multiple computers, network and other resources among multiple users.\\n\\nCloud computing model allows access to information and computer resources from anywhere where a network connection is available.\\n\\nMobile computing is the ability to use computing capability without a pre-defined location and /or connection to a network to publish and / or subscribe to information.\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\nNew Trends in Computing\\n\\nGrid computing applies the resources of numerous computers in a network to work on a single problem at the same time.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nObjective of green computing is study and practice of environmentally sustainable computing through information technology.\\n\\nTERMINAL EXERCISE\\n\\nWhat is cloud computing?\\n\\nWhat is virtualization and how does it improve resource utilization?\\n\\nHow we can develop eco-friendly environment for computing?\\n\\nWhat is mobile computing and what are its applications?\\n\\nWhat is grid computing and in which environment it is found very useful?\\n\\nANSWER TO INTEXT QUESTIONS\\n\\n12.1\\n\\nVirtualization\\n\\n(b) Static Environment.\\n\\n12.2\\n\\nMobile\\n\\nGrid\\n\\nGreen\\n\\nENGAGE WITH CUSTOMERS\\n\\nFor many organizations active and productive engagement of customers is a big challenge. It involves additional effort, skill and design on top of keeping the business running. However, many challenges businesses face can be resolved through better relationships with customers enabled by engaging them at the right moment with the right offer. Today\\'s consumers, however are much more empowered than in the past and are forcing companies to build plans that more perfectly cater to their actual wants and needs. This means that businesses must start doing a lot more to ensure the customer experience by living up to the demands of the modern consumer, both from a product perspective and, importantly, a customer service viewpoint.\\n\\nIn this lesson, the details and best practices of customer engagement and interactions are being discussed in detail. It will serve as a guide for employees who handle where customer interaction and engagement.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nAfter reading this lesson you will be able to:\\n\\neffectively interact with the customer prior to the visit.\\n\\nexplain customer\\'s requirements prior to and on visit.\\n\\nsuggest possible solutions for customers.\\n\\nunderstand the documentation process involved in customer engagement.\\n\\nimprove productivity and quality based on customer feedback.\\n\\nEngage with Customers\\n\\n13.1 INTERACTING WITH CUSTOMERS\\n\\nNotes The way you interact with your customers will determine how your customers identify you, your business and your products or services. It is important that you promote your company at every turn and this does not necessarily only involve times when you are meeting customers. Networking is something that you are doing every time you leave your house, you should always be as prepared as possible for meeting prospective clients and dealers. The interaction between a company and its customers is becoming more and more important. Interacting with your customers can go a long way in not only helping you develop your brand, but also in bringing in additional customers as well.\\n\\nFor effective engagement and interaction with customers, you need to look into following aspects:\\n\\nCall the customer based on inputs logged into customer care Check in the details of complaints, suggestions, feedbacks logged in by the customer. Try to understand the customer profile. Call the customer and discuss with them all the relevant issues with an open mind. A key element of delivering excellent customer service is the way that you interact and communicate with your customers.\\n\\nGreet the customer and listen to their problems attentively Greet customers in a courteous, friendly, and professional manner using agreed upon procedures. Listen attentively to customer needs and concerns; demonstrate empathy. Clarify customer requirements; probe for and confirm understanding of the problem customer is facing. Avoid prejudice - think about the words you are hearing and not the person saying them.\\n\\nCheck with customer about time for visit, field work and confirm location The customer visit should be well planned. There should be clear communication with respect to the time of visit, place and date. Meeting space should be booked well in advance. It’s always a good idea to communicate the agenda of the meeting well in advance.\\n\\nFollow etiquette when interacting with customers Everyone person who is supposed to interact with customers should be aware of company policies regarding the same. People interacting with customers reflect the image of the company. Give time to customer to explain the problem. Be patient whenever you hear the same question again and again. Be responsible by taking the responsibility for helping the customer.\\n\\nSeek feedback from customers after completion of work Project feedbacks are often ignored by the vendors or project teams, which are valuable in building a successful team and company. After completing each project, feedback from the customers becomes a self-evaluating tool for the team, more often they trigger process changes within the company. So for long term success of the organization, seeking feedback from the customers is key aspect after completion of the assigned task.\\n\\n172 Computer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\nEngage with Customers\\n\\n13.2 UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMER\\'S REQUIREMENTS\\n\\nUnderstanding customer requirements is the first step towards customer satisfaction.\\n\\nUnderstanding user requirements is a difficult task in any Industry. More so in new age technology driven companies, where the field is growing and customer expectations are changing fast. Changing technology makes the process of satisfying customers more difficult. Customer requirements are dynamic and can change very quickly depending on market conditions, the economy, the competition, etc. Address your customers the way they want to be perceived: as people who can be identified by names, phone numbers and email addresses.\\n\\nA business cannot survive without conducting ongoing efforts to better understand customer needs. To discover if your product or service is having a positive effect and creating customer loyalty, take time to determine your customer’s emotional and material needs, then offer valuable incentives for remaining loyal to your company. Getting customer feedback does not have to be expensive; from creating simple email surveys to taking an extra minute to engage on the sales floor, you can learn a lot about what customers want just by asking and listening. Also to learn more, you could even ask them for a little bit of time just to fill out a questionnaire.\\n\\n“What do our customers expect from us?” “What aspects of production could be changed while not affecting the satisfaction level of customers?” These are the questions to ask oneself when defining customer requirements and expectations. In our market-based economy, there is nothing more important than satisfying customer expectations and establishing long-term business relationships with clients, which is why meeting or exceeding the requirements of customers, with precision, time and time again, is essential to a successful or flourishing enterprise.\\n\\nUnderstanding the basic needs and a requirement of the customer is vital to managing a successful business. It’s a competitive world out there, and attention to detail and being helpful goes a long way. The needs and requirements for service and support differ greatly, by customer, by site, by usage, and by many other aspects too numerous to mention.\\n\\nFor effective understanding of customer’s requirement, you need to look into following aspects:\\n\\nUnderstand location requirements of customers.\\n\\nThe Customer Support Executive should ensure optimum operational performance for hardware systems installed at the customers’ site. They deliver technical service to customers including installation, relocation, repair and preventative maintenance. They optimize system performance to minimize equipment downtime and ensure maximum overall customer satisfaction. - Seek inputs to understand symptoms for the problem faced\\n\\nSeeking input from customers is an important component of effective customer service. Take the time to ask questions. Give customers the opportunity to express their opinions (both positive and negative) about the quality of the products and services.\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\n173\\n\\nEngage with Customers\\n\\nUse problem situations to obtain information from customers. A customer concern or complaint is really just a request for action. If you seek inputs from the customer, the symptoms of the problems faced will be more clear.\\n\\nAsk open and close ended questions to understand the problem faced Specific questions such as how or why questions, will invite positive interactions and will lead to better understanding of problem faced by the customer. Open ended questions are easy for the responder to answer and can lead to more specific questions. Closed questions, which require only a simple yes or no answer, yield less but specific information. Both are important and employees should develop the skill to ask right questions for effective resolution of problems faced by the customer.\\n\\nInform customer about the replacement or repair process After a product or service is delivered to a customer, there are continued opportunities to service the customer. This is a troubleshooting, repair and replacement, data collection and communications activity. These services are critical to customer satisfaction and provide excellent opportunities for long term engagement with customers. Customers should be politely and clearly communicated about the replacement or repair process if there are problems with the service or product being delivered. Be clear about the relevant company policy and communicate the same to the customer. Apologize for the issue if required.\\n\\nEnquire about warranty coverage Customer relation executives should clearly understand the warranty clauses for various products sold to the customers. They should enquire about the warranty coverage from the customers. In case there is a mismatch in the customers version and what the company policy is, the executive should inform the customer about it and ask him for the next steps (paid visits, purchase, extended warranty) etc.\\n\\nEducate about other useful products and maintenance contract While interacting with customers, it’s a good opportunity to educate them about various other products of the organization without making it sound like a sales pitch. Also inform them about the annual maintenance contract. These are agreements with customers to maintain and service equipment located at customers end. Such agreements are typically and preferably conveyed at the time the product is purchased. Service may initially be provided without separate charge during the warranty period, and then made available at pre-set rates in the years after any warranty has expired.\\n\\n13.3 SUGGESTING SOLUTIONS\\n\\nCustomers, buyers and clients want to pay a fair price for quality service or products, and feel satisfied they have paid for a service/product and received what they have paid for in return. They also want someone to take care of them. They need someone to understand their needs and help to answer them. Customer service starts with the ability to listen to the customer and find out through polite questioning to know their expectations.\\n\\nEngage with Customers\\n\\nCustomer service and contact with a client mean that the customer will be heard and their problems will not go unanswered or ignored. It also means getting to know your client, likes-dislikes, ideas, background, etc. The other most important aspect to do is to listen to what the customer is saying. If people do not understand what is appealing to the customer, they will not be successful in handling them. Do research on customers, their habits, and what they want and expect.\\n\\nOne commonality among all companies or organizations that provide good service is the development of a system and attitude promoting customer friendly service. By “customer friendly” we mean viewing the customer as the most important part of your job. The saying, “The customer is always right” is derived from this customer friendly environment.\\n\\nThe two main tasks of successful customer relations are to communicate and develop relationships. Positive dialogue/communication with your customers and developing ongoing relationships with your customers are perhaps the two most important qualities to strive for in customer service.\\n\\nWhen a customer asks you to do something that you do not know how to do or do not have the authority to do, become a facilitator by leading the customer to the person or department who can help them in solving the problem. Many inexperienced customer service representatives think by sympathizing with the customer’s trouble, he/she will win over the customer rather than actually doing something to solve the customer’s problem. If a customer expresses annoyance or frustration, do not make it worse by consoling with him/her. Understand the customer problem but seek to solve the problem.\\n\\nSuggesting appropriate solutions to customers takes some training and experience:\\n\\nSummarize the problem and suggest possible solutions\\n\\nSummarize the problem in a problem statement and get it validated by the customer so that it\\'s clear that you are solving the right problem.\\n\\nIf you can suggest a solution, do it. If not, tell the customer what actions you will take and what actions will follow. Never make the mistake of promising something you are not able to do. Suggest the customer alternative solutions, if they exist. Customers appreciate the opportunity to choose the ways of problem solving. Make sure that the promised measures are taken. If you do not fulfill what was promised and ignore the customer’s complaint, the problem will grow. Next time it will be more difficult to solve.\\n\\nEmphasizing what you can do for the customer and what’s unique about your solution creates a perception of value that can raise your proposal above the rest, even if other solutions might cost less.\\n\\nInform customers whether module needs to be replaced or repaired\\n\\nIf the customer is facing a problem with a particular product module which requires replacement or repair, the customer service executive should apologize for the trouble caused to the customer. Any such problem should be prioritized so that the customer feels comfortable. It should be resolved as soon as possible as it is impacting the customer experience about the product as well as the organization.\\n\\nEngage with Customers\\n\\nExplain to the customer about repair process, time taken and charges if any\\n\\nNotes: Having good systems in place ensures repairs are carried out correctly, within a reasonable time, and that the customer is kept informed. This is essential to ensuring the customer has confidence in your work. Where there are no legal obligations, offer a solution that in the circumstances best meets the needs of your business. For example, if the law says a customer is entitled to a repair, you may be willing to offer a replacement if that is what the customer wants and is not causing too much financial burden.\\n\\nSeek customer’s approval for further service\\n\\nIf there are value added services, inform and educate the customer about it and the applicable charges. Take customer’s approval before putting extra financial burden on the customer. If the customer is not ready to take the additional services, do not force the argument further.\\n\\n13.4 COMPLETING DOCUMENTATION\\n\\nProvide note to customer and retain a copy\\n\\nThe executives dealing with customers must provide a detailed note to customers about the problems and issues encountered by customer, what actions the company has taken to rectify the problem and the cost involved which needs to be paid by the customer. A copy of the same shall be retained by the company after taking signatures from the customer.\\n\\nProvide invoice for purchased parts\\n\\nProper invoice and bills shall be provided to the customer for all the parts purchased by the company or by the customer. It should include parts replaced or add on components/parts purchased.\\n\\n13.5 ACHIEVING PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY\\n\\nInteract with customers within specified time agreements\\n\\nEvery company has a detailed policy on customer interaction, clearly outlining the timelines for servicing a customer initiated complaint in Service Level Agreement (SLA). It’s a major objective for quality improvement for customer service agreement and must be tracked properly for improving the customer experience.\\n\\nIdentify the customer’s requirement and available resources\\n\\nFor new customers, the requirements shall be accurately identified to streamline the purchase process and enhance customer experience. Also executives shall be able to identify the resources and records at their end to let the customers know about the availability and timelines in a crisp manner.\\n\\nEngage with Customers\\n\\nAccurately assess the problem and suggest solutions Understanding the customer viewpoint on problems faced by him is very important to serve and suggest the possible solutions. It goes a long way to establish a relationship with customers. So the quality matrix must ensure that this assessment is properly measured.\\n\\nCommunicate problem effectively Customer executives not only need to assess the problem faced by customer but also need to communicate their understanding back to customer. A clearly understood problem wins customer’s confidence, so it’s an important measure of quality for customer service executives.\\n\\nGauge customer satisfaction during service visits A cordial discussion with customer regarding location, placement and other details about the module or equipment (product) sold to customer is important to understand their satisfaction with the product as well as service being provided.\\n\\nAchieve good feedback and customer satisfaction Every organization must strive hard to achieve 100% customer satisfaction and good feedback from the customers. It is important to win new clients for your products and services. It gives you a good starting point to sell your services and products to new customers.\\n\\n13.6 KNOW ABOUT YOUR COMPANY\\n\\nFrom organizational perspective, the concerned individuals dealing with customers should be aware of following aspects:\\n\\nCompany’s policies on customer care Every organization has clearly defined policies on how a customer service executive should deal with customers. Customer service executives as well as all those people who need to deal with customers like marketing executives should be aware of the company policy regarding the same.\\n\\nCompany’s code of conduct Employees should be aware of company’s code of conduct, both in terms of internal code of conduct and external code of conduct.\\n\\nOrganization culture and typical customer profile Employees should be well versed with the organization culture and values. They should also be acquainted about the typical customer profile to serve them better.\\n\\nCompany’s reporting structure Employees should know the reporting structure of the organization in order to escalate the matters which need immediate attention.\\n\\nEngage with Customers\\n\\nCompany’s documentation policy\\n\\nEmployees should be properly trained in documentation policy being followed by the organization vis-a-vis engagement with customers and clients. This is very handy in case of issues arising at a future date.\\n\\nFrom technical knowledge perspective, the concerned individuals requiring customer engagement roles should be aware of following aspects:\\n\\nCompanies products and recurring problems reported\\n\\nExecutives should be thoroughly aware of the products being sold by the company. They should also know about the recurring problems faced by many different customers and should suggest appropriate feedback for such issues to the satisfaction of customers. - Communication etiquettes\\n\\nCustomer service executives should be well trained in the etiquettes of communication with customers. They should be polite and good listeners. They should empathize with customers in case of severe problems faced by them. - Functionalities of various parts and modules\\n\\nCustomer service executives should be aware of various functions being performed by the modules and different parts of the system or product being sold to the customer. - Behavioral aspects at customers premise\\n\\nCustomer service executives dealing with on the field roles, should be well behaved and should interact with customers in a cordial manner whenever they are visiting the customer premise. - Precautions to be taken while dealing with customers\\n\\nMany a times, executives are faced with rowdy customers or phone calls. They should be patient and be well trained to take appropriate precautions while handling such calls or customers. - Appropriate reference sheets and manuals\\n\\nField service executives should carry appropriate reference sheets, manuals and other relevant documents at customer location which can make their task much easier.\\n\\nSKILLS\\n\\nApart from important aspects as discussed in above sections while engaging with customers, there are certain generic and professional skills which can enhance the customer experience and engagement further.\\n\\nGeneric Skills\\n\\nField executives dealing with customers should be able to read the product and module serial numbers and interpret the details like manufacturing date, model number etc. in an easy and fluid way. They should be able to document the issues on job sheet and also enter the details of work being done.\\n\\nEngage with Customers\\n\\nProfessional Skills\\n\\nProfessional skills include interpersonal skills which will help in developing the rapport with the customers. It improves the listening capabilities and executives are more aware about the problems and possible solutions. Communication skills are very important in order to seek inputs and assess the problem, making customer bit more relaxed about the issues and informing them about the contractual obligations in an easy manner. Behavioral skills include personal grooming, etiquettes on maintaining appropriate physical distance during conversation, being patient and courteous with customers. Decision making skills are also very important in situations where supervisor is not available or customer is being restless.\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 13.1\\n\\nWhich of the following is important for good customer engagement?\\n\\nA.

This has lead to increased importance of inter personal skills, both with our colleagues and superiors in order to obtain smooth work flow and achieve the company targets in an efficient way. This lesson is about the salient points which are required for individual’s level of communication with colleagues and other departments within the organization. It lays down objectively the qualities and abilities which determine the ability to work as a team member to achieve the required deliverables on schedule.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nAfter reading this lesson you will be able to:\\n\\ninteract with superiors smoothly.\\n\\ncoordinate with colleagues efficiently.\\n\\nexplain teamwork and multitasking.\\n\\nmake decisions.\\n\\n14.1 INTERACTING WITH SUPERIORS OR SUPERVISORS\\n\\nIn the workplace, interacting with other employees is one of the most critical aspects of synergy. When it comes to interacting with your immediate supervisor, the quality of your relationship can have an impact on every aspect of your job and the surrounding workplace. It can impact you and other employees in several ways.\\n\\nThe immediate supervisor of a department helps to set the tone for everything that goes on there. When you interact with your supervisor, the way that she/he treats you will determine how you work. So it’s important to develop a cordial relationship with the supervisor. This will lead to a much more soothing and cooperative environment in the organization. It will also lead to excellent results for the organization as well as individual.\\n\\nCoordinate with Colleagues\\n\\nTo have a good coordination and communication with the supervisor, the individual must proactively focus on following aspects:\\n\\nUnderstand and assess work requirements\\n\\nUnderstand the targets and incentives\\n\\nUnderstand new operating procedures and constraints\\n\\nReport problems in the field\\n\\nResolve personnel issues\\n\\nReceive feedback on work standards and customer satisfaction\\n\\nCommunicate any potential hazards at a particular location\\n\\nMeet given targets\\n\\nDeliver work of expected quality despite constraints\\n\\nReceive positive feedback on behavior and attitude shown during interaction\\n\\nUnderstand and Assess Work Requirements\\n\\nAll employees need to know what is expected from them at work and know how they are doing. No one can do their best without clear direction and ongoing, constructive feedback on their work performance. An employee has the responsibility to ensure that she/he understands the work objectives and strive to meet them.\\n\\nUnderstand the Targets and Incentives\\n\\nFully participate in performance discussions and meetings, welcoming them as opportunities to discuss your achievements, areas where you can improve, and your career interests.\\n\\nUnderstand new Operating Procedures and Constraints\\n\\nIn general, employees should thoroughly undergo training programs that have very specific and quantifiable goals, such as operating a particular piece of machinery, understanding a specific process, or performing certain procedures with great precision. They should interact with the supervisors if some part of the process or procedure is not clear to them.\\n\\nReport Problems in the Field\\n\\nWhen a problem pops up or a mistake occurs, respond to it proactively and don’t keep your supervisor in the dark. Communicate your own proposed solutions when you present the problem so that you and your supervisor have basis to start a problem solving conversation.\\n\\nResolve Personal Issues\\n\\nTo share a personal problem with your supervisor, you need to ensure the situation is something you should share. Before you disclose personal information, you need to ask\\n\\nCoordinate with Colleagues\\n\\nyourself whether the details you are about to convey would be better left unsaid. After analyzing the matter beforehand, you find that you must express problems of a personal nature to your superior, then be polite and ask for an appointment and thank your supervisor for the help and time he has provided.\\n\\nReceive Feedback and Customer Satisfaction Findings\\n\\nYour manager/supervisor will monitor your progress in achieving the required improvements by the deadlines specified in your action plan. At the end of this period, she/he will indicate in the action plan whether you have succeeded in achieving these improvements and will provide his or her comments on your efforts. As an employee, it’s always good to ask your supervisor to provide timely feedback. The feedback should be discussed and one should be open towards both criticism and suggested improvements.\\n\\nCommunicate any Potential Hazards\\n\\nEvery employee has the responsibility to bring notice of their supervisors any potential hazard or unwanted effect on surroundings and environment due to procedures, processes or unexpected events in their working location. It will prevent potential damage to the organization and supervisors in general will be very receptive towards such suggestions from employees.\\n\\nMeet given Targets\\n\\nAlthough discussions about your performance should occur throughout the year, take advantage of your mid-year review to discuss with your manager/supervisor whether your work objectives and/or learning and development plan should be adjusted. Once the targets are set after mutual discussion and agreement, employee should try her/his level best to achieve those targets as that will reflect positively for the supervisor. In case there are issues in achieving the targets even after putting up his/her best effort, the employee should consult the supervisor and discuss the future plan.\\n\\nDeliver Quality Work even under Constraints\\n\\nYou should clearly understand that in organizations, things are many times not perfect or ideal to execute a project. There can be different constraints, in terms of resources, cost, technology, skill set etc. As an employee, you should strive hard to deliver quality work under these given constraints. You should be upfront in discussing these constraints with the supervisor and get insights from them regarding best possible approach under the given circumstances. Normally, supervisor will be able to provide guidance which will be very useful as he/she might have faced similar situation earlier.\\n\\nReceive Positive Feedback for Behavior and Attitude\\n\\nMost often supervisors do recognize the hard work, good attitude and positive behavior in the employees. A frank and open discussion should be done by the employee with their superiors as far as an honest feedback is concerned. They should clearly communicate the times when they have shown good or ideal performance in terms of attitudes and behaviors.\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\n183\\n\\n14.2 COORDINATING WITH COLLEAGUES\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nBusiness organizations are, by definition, groups of people, but the formal use of teams as a way of organizing work has grown tremendously in the past half-century. The implication for anyone who wants a career in business is clear: it is virtually impossible to be successful in business without being successful in groups. Team communication is consistently named as a key skill for business success.\\n\\nMany employers define “good communication” as an ability to get along with others and behave pleasantly in the workplace. This attribute might seem more a personality trait than a communication skill, but for many employers it counts for more. Fortunately, you can learn to project a positive attitude, regardless of how you actually feel, and that in itself is an important business communication skill.\\n\\nWillingness to communicate and coordinate with colleagues is a developed skill, not something most people are born with. Even when they are busy with important work, you will find them more willing to work with you if they are comfortable with the personal relationships.\\n\\nIn turn, you should consistently show that you are willing to help others, get their work done. Some people worry more about being taken advantage of others than they do about the welfare of the group. Most co-workers consider this kind of an attitude as a “negative” one, and it will virtually always lose you the support of others—and often your job.\\n\\nApart from above mentioned general guidelines, to have an effective coordination and communication with the colleagues, the individual must proactively focus on following aspects:\\n\\nInteract with colleagues from different functions and understand the nature of the work.\\n\\nPass on customer complaints to colleagues in respective geographical area.\\n\\nAssist colleagues with resolving problems.\\n\\nResolve conflict for smooth work flow.\\n\\nFollow company policy for cross functional interactions.\\n\\nInteract with Colleagues from Different Functions\\n\\nWhen coordinating at the organization level, you need to reach out to other departments, request comments and negotiate approval. The challenge is to overcome opposition and gain acceptance. You won’t win them all. If not, get a written explanation from the dissenter. Present the objections to the supervisor for a decision on how to proceed.\\n\\nPass on Customer Complaints to Colleagues in respective geographical area\\n\\nMany contact centers exist to provide information and support to customers using a range of services or products. Providing that support requires detailed knowledge and\\n\\nCoordinate with Colleagues\\n\\nUnderstanding of the services and/or products together with the communication skills to deal with customers. It also involves teamwork so that colleagues learn from each other as the organization gains experience and services and/or products develop.\\n\\nAssist Colleagues with Resolving Problems\\n\\nOne of the most important hiring criteria for many companies is the ability to work as a team player. Teamwork in general is part of performance management system. So it’s important for anyone not only to seek help of peers and superiors but also to readily offer help to colleagues who are in need for resolution of technical and other problems in the organization. Although some people believe it is best to keep work life and personal life separate, and therefore avoid making friends with colleagues, for most people, having strong friendships makes work more fun.\\n\\nLook forward at work by supporting and developing your colleagues. You can begin with showing genuine interest in their lives, asking them for opinions and caring about them. Share about yourself and build trust. Involve others in your projects or collaborate on ideas. Share your knowledge and proficiency while learning from your colleagues. You will make work a better place to be.\\n\\nResolve Conflict for Smooth Work Flow\\n\\nCoordination helps to minimize the conflicts, wastages, delays and other organizational problems. It ensures smooth working of the organization. Therefore, with the help of coordination an organization can achieve its objectives easily and quickly. Handling and resolving conflicts that arise in the workplace is one of the biggest challenges managers and employees face. Typically there are two responses to conflict: run away (avoidance) or ‘battle it out’. In either case, you often feel uncomfortable or dissatisfied with the results because no resolution has been achieved. By learning to constructively resolve conflict, you can turn a potentially destructive situation into an opportunity for creativity and enhanced performance.\\n\\nArriving at a positive resolution of conflict is always the ultimate goal. In resolving conflict, it is important to make sure you do the following:\\n\\nClearly express the causes of the conflict – openly acknowledging there will be differing perceptions of the problem(s).\\n\\nMake a clear statement of why you want the conflict resolved and reasons to work on conflict.\\n\\nCommunication of how you want the conflict resolved.\\n\\nAddress the issues face-to-face (notes, email correspondence, memos are not a productive way to resolve differences).\\n\\nStick to the issues. In trying to resolve conflict, it is tempting to resort to name calling or bring up issues from the past. It is important to address specific behaviors and situations if change is to take place.\\n\\nComputer Hardware Assembly and Maintenance\\n\\nCoordinate with Colleagues\\n\\nTake time out if necessary. In the resolution of a conflict, our emotions may interfere with arriving at a productive resolution. If this transpires, take a time-out and resume resolving the conflict at another designated time.\\n\\nFollow Company Policy for Cross Functional Interaction\\n\\nCross-functional teams provide an organization with some significant advantages. You can greatly increase creativity and problem solving with the use of cross-functional teams because of their composition. Members of cross-functional teams come with a diversity of experiences, expertise and knowledge. This diversity can help broaden perspectives and create a synergy - where interaction of the members create a greater effect than the sum effects of each member acting alone - leading to a high level of creativity. Companies have consciously developed policies and incentives for cross functional roles. One should be aware of these policies and should discuss the same with colleagues and supervisors if anything is not clear.\\n\\nReceive Feedback and Customer Satisfaction Findings\\n\\nCheck with your superior and colleagues from quality department, about the ratings, feedbacks, comments and observations you and your team has got from customers, clients and other groups dependent on you. Take the feedback in positive spirit, both good and bad. Appreciate your team for the good feedback being received, discuss the negative feedback with a sense of improving the quality of services and deliverables. Do not try to argue or start blame game in case the feedback received in not on expected lines. It does not serve any purpose. There is always a scope of improvement and you along with your team should focus on that.\\n\\n14.3 ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT\\n\\nWhile most employees are aware of a company’s general mission upon getting hired, the precise details should be spelled out and distributed to each employee. Mission statements include things such as sales goals and marketing initiatives, where a company has been and where it hopes to go. This should include top management’s vision of the company. Employees should orient themselves towards companies goal while understanding the company policies and also improving upon their knowledge with respect to the skill set required to accomplish the tasks effectively.\\n\\n14.4 UNDERSTANDING COMPANY POLICIES\\n\\nAll employers set general policies regarding employee conduct. This includes guidelines on what is considered appropriate behavior between two employees, as well as employees and managers and employees and customers.\\n\\nEmployees have a wide range of pay, but those who work for the same company are often paid on the same day. Policies and procedures are outlined when employees will be paid. Employees should also be aware if direct deposit is available, as well as the guidelines on bonus pay and reimbursement for mileage and other work-related expenses.\\n\\nCoordinate with Colleagues\\n\\nCompanies that offer health benefits also include key aspects, such as pricing for individuals and families, in their list of employee policies and procedures. Many companies also have a mandatory waiting period of anywhere from 30 to 90 days before benefits become available to an employee. Employees should be aware of these policies and should discuss with HR or other concerned department in case of any confusion.\\n\\nEmployee policies and procedures consist of every imaginable situation and topic, ensuring that employees understand all aspects of working for a company. That includes policies on acceptable attire, safety, termination and resignation, working from home and overtime. It is important that employees are trained on these aspects from time to time and it’s the responsibility of the employees to discuss these with colleagues and superiors if required.\\n\\n14.5 INDIVIDUALS ROLE IN WORKFLOW\\n\\nUnderstanding your job role and description is the most important aspect when starting a new job. This will ensure that you ultimately understand the tasks and duties that you are expected to fulfill in order to earn your remuneration and also add value to the company you work for.\\n\\nMake sure you understand:\\n\\nThe job duties you are expected to perform;\\n\\nYour supervisor’s expectations for your job performance; and\\n\\nThe performance review process that will be used for your position.\\n\\nTalk to your supervisor if you are unsure of the work that you are expected to perform or the standards you are expected to meet in order to gain a better understanding of his or her expectations. If there are things you think you need help with to be successful, discuss them with your supervisor. These could be instructions, training, support/cooperation from coworkers, etc.\\n\\n14.6 REPORTING STRUCTURE\\n\\nReporting structure refers to the authority relationships in a company — who reports to whom. For small businesses with only a couple of employees, that structure is often self-evident: Everyone reports to the owner. With enough new employees, though, coordinating everyone’s efforts will likely demand a formal organizational structure. This framework establishes who is in charge of different tasks, departmental areas and the organization as a whole. These authority boundaries and the relationships among people in authority serve to create the reporting structure.\\n\\nOrganizational structure provides guidance to all employees by laying out the official reporting relationships that govern the workflow of the company. A formal outline of a company’s structure makes it easier to add new positions in the company, as well, providing a flexible and ready means for growth.\\n\\n14.7 EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION\\n\\nNotes The success of an individual in a team depends greatly on the extent to which she/he can engage in effective communication. Faulty communication in organizations can lead to lowered efficiency and effectiveness at the organizational as well as individual level. Skill to communicate depends on the capacity of an individual to convey ideas and feelings to another to evolve a desired response. In management, communication is a mixture of personal attributes and organizational aspects. Good communication is necessary for all organizations as management functions in organizations are carried out through communication.\\n\\nEffective management is a function of effective communication. Interpersonal communication takes places every time we interact with others. Communication is considered effective when it succeeds in evoking a desired response from the other person. Moreover failures in communication can be very costly for the organization by way of reduced co-operation and subsequent ill feeling between employees. Communication, to be effective, cannot be a random process. It has to be planned and executed so that it evokes the desired response.\\n\\nCommunication in organizations has the following role:\\n\\nHelps in fostering motivation function of control\\n\\nAids in the function of control\\n\\nProvides information for making decisions\\n\\nGives vent to one’s feelings\\n\\nHelps in the satisfaction of social needs\\n\\nMeasuring the effectiveness of your communication is just as important as delivering it. Measurement is key to understanding the success of your communications and an opportunity to invite feedback.\\n\\nYou can measure communications in many ways using informal and formal channels. A good communicator makes use of the measurement systems available within your organization, but also uses the most powerful form of measurement – feedback. By inviting feedback you can not only measure the success of the communication, but also enter into valuable two-way dialogue, which will help your future communications and engage the audience with your message and the company.\\n\\n14.8 BUILD TEAM COORDINATION\\n\\nCoordination is the act of organizing and enabling different people to work together to achieve an organization’s goals. It is a managerial function in which different activities of the business are properly adjusted and interlinked.\\n\\nCoordinate with Colleagues\\n\\nEmployees within the functional divisions of an organization tend to perform a specialized set of tasks, such as engineering. This leads to operational efficiency within that group. However, it can also lead to a lack of communication between various functional groups within an organization, rendering the organization slow and inflexible.\\n\\nIncreasing coordination internally can be accomplished by keeping all moving parts of the organization on the same page. There are a number of ways to improve upon the coordination of different departments, work groups, teams, or functional specialists. These include creating a well-communicated and accurate mission statement; clearly defining strategic objectives; monitoring and evaluating each functional group; providing company-wide updates and communications from each department; and, wherever possible, promoting cross-departmental meetings and projects.\\n\\nStructure is a central determinant of effective coordination across an organization as it enables communications, underlines responsibilities, and provides concrete authority in decision-making.\\n\\n14.9 TEAM WORK AND MULTITASKING\\n\\nTeam projects often arise in the workplace whether one likes it or not. Being successful with this skill means working productively with a variety of people, utilizing the various skills within the group, and overcoming any differences between members. Being able to communicate and relate effectively with your coworkers is not only beneficial to you but your employer as well. Relationship building with coworkers makes work more enjoyable for you and saves your supervisors from having to resolve conflicts between employees.\\n\\nBusinesses are always happy to drive down costs, and the best way to do this is by hiring fewer individuals who can multi-task. It is often the case that one efficient employee can do the work of two typical employees. Employees are paid for the hours they work, and employers want to get the most out of what they pay. An employee who can complete multiple tasks at once is the solution.\\n\\nThe best way to use multitasking skill is:\\n\\nUse your past experience while carrying out a new task even if the previous task was not related to the current assignment, there’s always the scope of applying past learning in the current situation. Look out for such opportunities.\\n\\nPrepare a list of projects that required you to separate tasks into clusters that could be addressed simultaneously. Use these to carry out multi-tasking assignments.\\n\\nShow a willingness to take on many responsibilities. Any worker can pick up one or two, but if you can pick up more without getting spread too thin, you become a valuable asset.\\n\\n14.10 DECISION MAKING\\n\\nDecision making can be defined as the process of making choices among possible alternatives. The skills considered important to effective decision making are based on a standard model of decision making, which prescribes how decisions should be made. These skills include: 1) identifying the possible options; 2) identifying the possible\\n\\nCoordinate with Colleagues\\n\\nConsequences that follow from each option; 3) evaluating the desirability of each of the consequences; 4) assessing the likelihood of each consequence; and 5) making a choice using a “decision rule”.\\n\\nProblem solving and decision-making are important skills for business and life. Problem-solving often involves decision-making, and decision-making is especially important for management and leadership. There are processes and techniques to improve decision-making and the quality of decisions.\\n\\nDefine and clarify the issue.\\n\\nGather all the facts and understand their causes.\\n\\nThink about or brainstorm possible options and solutions.\\n\\nConsider and compare the ‘pros and cons’ of each option - consult others if necessary or useful - and for bigger complex decisions where there are several options, create a template which enables measurements according to different strategic factors.\\n\\nSelect the best option - avoid vagueness and weak compromises in trying to please everyone.\\n\\nExplain your decision to those involved and affected, and follow up to ensure proper and effective implementation.\\n\\nAn important area where decision making process becomes critical is at the time of unforeseen disruptions in the work flow. Employees should be able to take informed decisions at such times. Normally, every organization develops its own set of best practices to deal with such emergency situations. Employees should be aware of such best practices and should be able to communicate to the supervisor if that is required. They should be aware of their responsibilities and should make appropriate judgment regarding whether to inform the superior or to handle the situation along with other colleagues.\\n\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 14.1\\n\\nWhich of the following is important for good coordination with supervisor?\\n\\nA.
